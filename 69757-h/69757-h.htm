</div>

<p>I have been asked to write a short introduction to this
book, and I have no hesitation in complying with the
request.</p>

<p>Although the high motives and disinterested devotion
which inspire missionary and philanthropic effort are
very generally recognized, there is often a predisposition—more
frequently felt than expressed—not only amongst
responsible officials but also in the minds of no inconsiderable
portion of the public to accept with some
reserve both the accuracy of the facts and the soundness
of the conclusions emanating wholly from these sources.
This scepticism, provided it be not allowed to degenerate
into unworthy prejudice, is not merely healthy but
even commendable. I could mention cases within my
own knowledge where missionary zeal was certainly
allowed to outrun discretion. It is the duty of responsible
officials to be sceptical in such matters. Whilst sympathizing
with humanitarians they should endeavour to remedy
whatever of quixotism is to be found in their suggestions;
and to guide those from whom those suggestions emanate
along a path calculated to ensure the achievement of
their objects by the adoption of practical methods which
will be consonant with the moral and material interests
of the Empire at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span></p>

<p>Occasional errors, the result of unchecked enthusiasm
in a noble cause, cannot, however, for one moment be
allowed to outweigh the immense benefits conferred on
civilization by missionary and philanthropic agencies.
Nowhere have these benefits been more conspicuous than
in the case of the Congo.</p>

<p>The fact that but a few years ago the administration
of the Congo was a disgrace to civilized Europe is now
so fully recognized, not only in this country, but also—to
the honour of the Belgians be it said—in Belgium
itself, that it is scarcely necessary to labour the point.
One startling fact is sufficient to demonstrate its
true character. According to an estimate made by
Sir Reginald Wingate,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the population of the Soudan
under the Mahdi’s rule was reduced from 8,525,000 to
1,870,500 persons; in other words over 75 per cent. of
the inhabitants died from disease or were killed in
external or internal wars. The civilized European who
for some years presided over the destinies of the Congo
was no more merciful, save as a matter of percentage,
than the ignorant and fanatical Dervish at Khartoum.
Mr. Harris states (<a href="#Page_208">p. 208</a>) that, under the régime of King
Leopold, the Congo population was reduced from 20,000,000
to 8,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> More than this. It is generally impossible
in the long run to pronounce a complete divorce between
moral and material interests. It will, therefore, be no
matter for surprise that the Leopoldian policy was as
unsuccessful from an economic as it was from an humanitarian
point of view. It is now clear that unbridled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
company-mongering has gone far to destroy the sources
of wealth to which it owed its birth. Mr. Harris tells a
piteous tale of the manner in which the rubber vines
have been handled, and, generally of the condition of the
plantations. Neither, having regard to the wanton
destruction of elephants (<a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a>) does ivory appear to
have been much more tenderly treated than rubber.</p>

<p>Even the most hardened sceptic as regards the
utility of missionary enterprise will not, I think, be
prepared to deny that to the Missionaries, in conjunction
with Mr. Morel, the main credit accrues of having
brought home to the British public, and eventually to
the public of Europe, the iniquities which, but a short
time ago, were being practised under European sanction
in the heart of Africa.</p>

<p>Amongst this devoted band, many of whom have
paid with their lives the heavy toll which cruel Africa
exacts, none have been more steadfast in their determination
to insist on the reform of the Congo administration
than the writer of this book—Mr. Harris. None, moreover,
have brought a more evenly-balanced mind to
bear on the numerous problems which perplex the
African administrator. Mr. Harris may be an enthusiast,
but of this I am well convinced—both by frequent personal
intercourse and from a careful perusal of his work—that
his enthusiasm is tempered by reason and by a
solid appreciation of the difference between the ideal
and the practical. He wisely (<a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>) deprecates undue
Missionary interference with local customs. He has even
something (<a href="#Page_58">pp. 58-60</a>) to say in palliation of polygamy,
and if I rightly understand his remarks on <a href="#Page_154">p. 154</a>, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
does not utterly exclude a resort to forced labour under
certain conditions and under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Moreover, in so far as my experience enables me to
form an opinion, Mr. Harris has acquired a firm grasp
of the main principles which should guide Europeans
who are called upon to rule over a backward and primitive
society, and of the fact that prolonged neglect of those
principles must sooner or later lead to failure or even
disaster. He writes as a fair-minded and thoroughly
well-informed observer. Throughout his pages may be
found many acute observations on the various problems
which, in forms more or less identical, tax the ingenuity
of the governing race wherever the white and the coloured
man meet as ruler and subject. Notably Mr. Harris
dwells (<a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>) on the great influence exerted by the
example set by officials; this example, he thinks—most
rightly in my opinion—is more important than the issue
of laws and decrees. Here, he says—and I quote the
passage with regret—“is where the Belgian and French
Congo officials have failed so utterly.” To put the matter
in another, and somewhat mathematical, form, I have
always held that 75 per cent. of the influence of British
officials for good depends on character, and only 25 per
cent. on brains. Mistakes arising from defective intelligence
will generally admit to being rectified. Those
which are due to defects of character are more often
irremediable. My belief is that the great and well-deserved
success which has attended Sir Reginald
Wingate’s administration of the Soudan arises in no
small degree from a recognition of this common-place,
and from its practical application in the choice of officials.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
I am not sure that its importance is always adequately
recognized in London. It is well to encourage the
importation of cocoa and palm oil into the London
market. But it is better to acquire the reputation, which
(<a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a>) Mr. Harris says has passed into a proverb in the
Congo, that “the Englishman never lies.”</p>

<p>For these reasons I have no hesitation in recommending
this book to the public. Mr. Harris’ facts may perhaps
be called in question by others possessing greater local
knowledge than any to which I can pretend. His conclusions—notably
those in his final chapter in which he
re-arranges the map of Africa in a somewhat daring
spirit—manifestly admit of wide differences of opinion.
But he speaks with a unique knowledge of his subject.
The opportunities which, with praiseworthy zeal, he and
his devoted companion made for themselves to acquire a
real knowledge of African affairs has been exceptional.
He has thus produced a book in which the ordinary
reader cannot fail to be interested if it is only by reason
of the vivid and picturesque account it gives of African
life and travel, and in which those who have paid special
attention to African administration will find many
useful indications of the directions in which their efforts
towards reform may best be applied. Whatever may be
thought of some of Mr. Harris’ suggestions, it cannot but
be an advantage, more especially now that attention is
being more and more drawn to African affairs, that the
Government, Parliament, and the general public should
learn what one so eminently qualified as Mr. Harris to
instruct them in the facts of the case has to say on the
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Harris is not sparing in his criticisms, neither
does he withhold praise when he considers it is due.
Whilst strongly condemning the slavery—for such it
virtually is—that the Government of Portugal permits
in its Colonies, he dwells (<a href="#Page_296">p. 296</a>) on the “kindly nature”
of the Portuguese themselves, and significantly adds
“there is no colour-bar in the Portuguese dominions.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
He appears to find little to commend in French administration,
and much (<a href="#Page_90">pp. 90 and 91</a>) to condemn in their
commercial policy. He does justice (<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>) to the
thoroughness and wisdom of the Germans in all matters
connected with trade, and does not, as I venture to
think, detract from the merits of the liberal policy which
they have adopted by alluding to the fact that it is
based on self-interested motives. On the other hand, he
strongly condemns (<a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>) the German treatment of
the natives. He dwells (<a href="#Page_92">p. 92</a>) on the petty and vexatious
obstacles placed in the way of a trade by the Belgian
officials of the Congo, of which “even Belgian merchants
complain,” and he has, of course, little to say in favor
of Belgian administration in other respects. But he
has the fairness to admit (<a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>) that since the annexation
of the Congo by Belgium the death rate has diminished
and the birth rate increased—a fact which, after the
experiences of the Leopoldian régime, appears to me to
be very eloquent, and to reflect much credit on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
Belgian Government. Moreover, he tells us that “wherever
the Belgian reforms have been most completely
applied, there the ravages of sleeping sickness appear to
be more or less checked.”</p>

<p>These observations are interesting, as they enable a
comparison to be made with the results obtained under
different systems of government, but they deal with
matters for which—save to a limited degree in the
Congo, and also perhaps to some slight extent as regards
the continuance of slavery in the Portuguese possessions—neither
the British Government nor the British nation
are in any degree responsible. The internal policy to be
adopted in the African territories possessed by France
and Germany is a matter solely for the consideration of
Frenchmen and Germans. But Mr. Harris has a good
deal to say about the conduct of affairs in British African
possessions, and it will be well if public attention is
directed to his remarks in this connection, lest having
preached to others we may ourselves become castaways.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris’ position is so completely detached that
he may, without the least hesitation, be acquitted of
any desire to exalt unduly the achievements of his own
countrymen. The spirit in which he writes is not
national, but cosmopolitan. Moreover, he is manifestly
not greatly enamoured of the proceedings of some, at
all events, of the British officials. For these reasons his
testimony is all the more valuable when he speaks, as
is frequently the case, in terms of warm praise of the
successful results which have been attained under British
administration. He says it is not only the best in West
Central Africa, but that the natives themselves recognize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
that it is the best. This testimony is all the more
satisfactory because the excellence of British rule has not
been always fully recognized in those circles in which
Mr. Harris principally moves. “With inherent instinct,”
he says (<a href="#Page_257">p. 257</a>), “the British Government recognizes
that the real asset of the Colony (<i>i.e.</i> the Gold Coast
Colony) is the indigenous inhabitant, whose material and
moral progress is not only the first, but the truest interest
of the State.” It is by proceeding on this sound principle
that the natives have been kept in possession of the
land. “The almost phenomenal success of the cocoa
industry in the British Colony of the Gold Coast,” Mr.
Harris says (<a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>), “is due entirely to the fact that
the natives are the proprietors of the cocoa farms.”
It is also by the adoption of this principle that it has
been possible to solve the thorny labour question.
“The native farmers of Southern Nigeria and the Gold
Coast employ a good deal of native labour and generally
speaking find little difficulty in obtaining all they want”
(<a href="#Page_262">p. 262</a>).<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. Harris claims (<a href="#Page_264">p. 264</a>) that the economic
will be no less satisfactory than the moral results of the
liberal policy which has been adopted by Great Britain,
and that “the indigenous industry of the British Colonies
working in its own interests, unencumbered by the heavy
cost of European supervision and the drawbacks of
imported contract labour, will, under the guidance of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
paternal and sympathetic administration, certainly outdistance
and leave far behind in the race of supremacy
such systems as those which prevail in San Thomé and
Principe.” I trust, and I also believe, that Mr. Harris
will prove to be a true prophet.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, the adoption of the principle to which
I have alluded above which enabled an American Bishop
(<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>) to characterize as “just marvellous” the way in
which the English are “covering the Continent with
educated natives,” and I am particularly glad he was able
to add “with carpenters, bricklayers, and engineers.”</p>

<p>In spite, however, of the unstinted praise which Mr.
Harris has to bestow and which makes it clear that,
broadly speaking, we may legitimately be proud of what
our countrymen, both official and non-official, have
accomplished in Western Africa, he indicates certain
defects in the administration, some of which appear to
me to be well worthy of the attention of the responsible
authorities.</p>

<p>In the first place, he says (<a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>) that “between
the British official class and the merchant community a
great gulf is fixed.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> If this is the case, there would
certainly appear to be something wrong. There ought
to be no such gulf. But as I presume there is an official
side to the case, which I have never heard, I do not
presume to pronounce any opinion on the merits of the
point at issue. Neither is it altogether pleasant to read
the episode related on <a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>. It is clearly not right to
march into a church whilst service is going on, impound
a number of carriers and “insist on a native clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
carrying a box containing whisky.” One may charitably
hope that the facts of the case were not quite accurately
reported to Mr. Harris.</p>

<p>In the absence of adequate local knowledge I cannot
pursue the discussion of this branch of the subject any
further, but there is one observation I should wish to
make. There cannot be a greater mistake than to
employ underpaid officials in the outlying dominions of
the Crown. We do not want the worst, or even the
second best of our race to prosecute the Imperial policy
to which we are wedded as a necessity of our national
existence. The work presents so many difficulties of
various descriptions that if we are to succeed we must
impound into the British service the best elements which
our race can produce, and, as I am well aware, even when
their services are obtained and every care has been
taken, mistakes will sometimes occur in making appointments.
And if we want the best material we must pay
the best price for it. Men of the required type will not
submit to all the privations and discomforts, not to speak
of the dangers of an African career unless they are
adequately remunerated. I know well from bitter
experience the difficulties attendant on paying high
salaries out of an impoverished, and even out of a semi-bankrupt
Treasury. And I also know the criticisms to
which, notably in these democratic days, the payment
of high salaries is exposed. My answer to the first of
these objections is that if the Treasury cannot afford to
give adequate salaries to its European agents it is, on all
grounds, wiser to diminish the amount of European
agency, or even to dispense with it altogether. My own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
experience has led me to prefer infinitely the employment
of two efficient men on £500 a year to that of four doubtfully
efficient men on £250. My answer to the second
objection is that those who plead against high salaries
are generally very ill-informed of the facts with which
they are dealing, and that, if ever there was a case when
Government, being better informed, should resist a hasty
expression of public opinion, it is this.</p>

<p>Are the British agents employed in subordinate positions
in Africa adequately paid? From all I have heard I
have considerable doubts whether they are so. In dealing
with this subject, I have heard it sometimes said:
“Candidates are plentiful. If we can get a man on £250
a year or less, why should we give him £500?” I consider
this argument not merely pernicious but ridiculous.
It would never be used by any one who has been brought
face to face with the difficulties which have actually to
be encountered. Its application in practice is liable to
lead to very serious consequences in the shape of loss of
national credit, and possibly in other and even more
serious directions.</p>

<p>Turning to another point, I notice (<a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>) that Mr.
Harris states that coloured men are practically debarred
from entering the medical service in the West African
Colonies, and absolutely in the Gold Coast. If so, I can
only say that this regulation contrasts unfavourably
with the procedure adopted in other British possessions
of which the inhabitants are coloured, and adopted,
moreover, without, so far as I am aware, the production
of any inconvenience. Possibly there are some special
reasons, with which I am unacquainted, which apply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
to West Africa, but they must be very strong to justify
a course so little in harmony with the general practice
and policy of the British Government elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris deals fully with the subject of education,
and in his fifth chapter chivalrously defends the cause
of that much-abused individual the “educated native,”
whose merits and demerits seem to present a striking
identity of character whether his residence be on the banks
of the Ganges, the Nile, or the Congo. The old complaint
with which Indian administrators are so familiar, that
the education afforded is too purely literary, re-appears
in West Africa. Mr. Harris, however, dwells with justifiable
pride (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>) on the number of carpenters, bricklayers
and other mechanics turned out of the Mission
Schools, and (<a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a>) he most rightly insists on the
importance of extending “that largely neglected branch
of education—practical agriculture.” He suggests that
a Commission should be appointed “to study the whole
question of the education of the African peoples in
British Equatorial possessions, with the object of
ascertaining how far the Government may be able to
secure a more even balance between the literary and
technical training of natives, and how far it may be
possible to so re-adjust existing systems as to avoid
denationalization.”</p>

<p>My confidence in the results obtained by appointing
Royal Commissions is limited, but they afford a useful
machinery for classifying facts and sifting evidence, and
thus provide some safeguard against the risk, which is
nowhere more conspicuous than in dealing with educational
subjects, of generalizing from imperfect or incorrect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
data. Mr. Harris’ suggestion on this point will, I trust,
receive due consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris also dwells (<a href="#Page_113">pp. 113, 114</a>) on the results
which ensue when young Africans are sent to England
to obtain legal or medical education. “No strong and
friendly hand is outstretched to help them, no responsible
person comes forward to take them by the hand and bring
them in touch with the better elements of our national
life.... Who can be surprised if the only seeds they
carry back to the Colonies are those evil ones which
produce a crop of tares to the embarrassment of
Governments?”</p>

<p>If the Colonial Office and the Missionary Societies,
acting either independently or in unison with each other,
can devise any satisfactory solution of this very important
and also extremely difficult problem, they will earn the
gratitude of all who are interested in the well-being of
our Asiatic and African dominions. Palliatives for the
evils which most assuredly arise under the existing
system have been tried by the Governments of India and
Egypt, but so far as I know the success of these efforts
has not been very marked. I may mention that, so
convinced was I that the harm done by sending young
Egyptians to England for purposes of education more
than counterbalanced the advantages which were obtained
that at the cost of a good deal of misrepresentation—which
was quite natural under the circumstances—I
persistently discouraged the practice, and urged that a
preferable system was so to improve higher and technical
education on the spot as to render the despatch of students
to Europe no longer necessary. I fear, however, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
efforts in this respect were not altogether successful, for
although higher education in Egypt has unquestionably
been much improved, the idea that European attainments
can best be cultivated in Europe itself has taken so strong
a hold both on Egyptian parents and on the Egyptian
governing classes, that it is well-nigh impossible to
eradicate it.</p>

<p>By far, however, the most interesting and also the most
important part of Mr. Harris’ work is that in which he
deals with the future of the African possessions of Belgium
and Portugal respectively. Even if I had at my disposal
all the information necessary to a thorough treatment
of these questions, it would not be possible to deal adequately
with the grave issues raised by Mr. Harris within
the limits of the present introduction. I confine myself,
therefore, to a very few observations.</p>

<p>As regards the Congo, if I understand Mr. Harris’
view correctly, the situation, broadly speaking, is somewhat
as follows. Reforms have been executed, and a
serious effort, the sincerity of which he does not call in
question, has been made to rectify abuses for which
neither the Belgian Parliament nor the Belgian nation
are in any degree responsible. But although abuses have
been checked, the main cause from which they originally
sprung has not yet been entirely removed. That cause
is that the Government, whose functions should be mainly
confined to administration, is still largely interested in
commercial enterprises. The State has not yet completely
divorced itself from the production of rubber for
sale in the European markets. Moreover, the old officials,
who are tainted with Leopoldian practices, are still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
employed. Mr. Harris even goes so far (<a href="#Page_221">p. 221</a>) as to
state that their presence acts as a deterrent to the employment
of Belgian officials of a higher type.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Mr. Harris
thinks—and, for my own part, I do not doubt rightly
thinks—that so long as this defective system<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> exists,
radical reform of the Congo administration will remain incomplete.
But radical reform can only be carried out at
a very heavy cost, which the Belgian taxpayers, more
especially after the assurances which have been given to
them, will be unwilling to bear, and possibly incapable
of bearing. Mn Harris, therefore, thinks that the Belgian
people will be unable to perform the heavy task which,
from no fault of their own, has been thrust upon them.
“There are reasons,” he says (<a href="#Page_298">p. 298</a>), “for believing that
the extensive Congo territories are too heavy a responsibility
for Belgium.”</p>

<p>It is very possible that Mr. Harris’ diagnosis is correct.
But what is to be the remedy? The remedy which he
suggests is that Germany should take over the greater
part of the Belgian and a portion of the French Congo,
and (<a href="#Page_302">p. 302</a>) should concede “an adequate <i>quid pro quo</i>”
to France. I will not attempt to discuss fully this suggestion
which, to the diplomatic mind, is somewhat startling.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
I will only say that I very greatly doubt the feasibility
of arranging any such “adequate <i>quid pro quo</i>” for
France as Mr. Harris seems to contemplate. The British
attitude in connection with any transfer of the Congo
State from its present rulers to Germany appears to me,
however, to be abundantly clear. If any amicable
arrangement could be made by which Germany should
enter into possession of the Congo, we may regard it,
from the point of view of British interests, without the
least shadow of disfavour or jealousy, but—and this
point appears to me to be essential—it must be of such a
nature as will not in any degree impair the very friendly
relations which now fortunately exist between our own
country and France. The well-being of the Congo
State, however deserving of consideration, must be rated
second in importance to the steadfast maintenance of
an arrangement fraught with the utmost benefit not merely
to France and England, but to the world in general.</p>

<p>Failing any such rather heroic measures as those proposed
by Mr. Harris, the only alternative would appear
to be to rely on Belgian action, and to exercise continuous
but steady and very friendly pressure in the direction of
crowning the work of the Congo reformers. It would be
unjust not to recognize the great difficulties which a
series of untoward events has created for Belgium. It
may well be that if this course is adopted the progress
of reform will be relatively slow, and that in the end it
will be less effective than that which would be secured
by an immediate and radical change of system. But I
rise from a perusal of Mr. Harris’ pages with a feeling that
Congo reformers have no cause for despair, albeit their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
ideals may be impossible of realization in the immediate
future.</p>

<p>The case of Portugal is, from the British point of view,
if not less difficult, certainly far more simple than that of
the Congo. If one-half of what Mr. Harris says is correct—and
I see no reason whatever to doubt the accuracy of
his facts—two points are abundantly clear. The first is
that however it may be disguised by an euphemistic
nomenclature, slavery virtually exists in the African possessions
of Portugal. The second is that the methods
adopted in the repatriation of the slaves are open to very
strong and very legitimate criticism. The process of
dumping down a number of starving blacks on the coast
of the mainland and leaving them to find their own way
to their distant homes in Central Africa can scarcely be
justified.</p>

<p>Portugal is justly proud of her historical connection
with Africa and wishes to retain her African possessions.
We may heartily sympathize with this honourable wish.
I know of no adequate reasons for supposing that the
present political status of those possessions is threatened.
But, I venture to think, it would be a mistaken kindness
to leave the Portuguese under any delusion on one point.
There are some things which no British Government,
however powerful otherwise, can undertake to perform.
First and foremost amongst those things is the use of
the warlike strength of the British Empire to maintain
a slave State. In spite of the long-standing friendship
between the two countries, in spite of historical associations
which are endeared to all Englishmen, and in spite of
the apparently unequivocal nature of treaty engagements,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span>
it would, I feel assured, be quite impossible, should the
African possessions of Portugal be seriously menaced,
for British arms to be employed in order to retain them
under the uncontrolled possession of Portugal, so long
as slavery is permitted. It is earnestly to be hoped that,
before any such contingency can arise, the Portuguese
Government will have removed the barrier which now
exists by totally abolishing a system which is worthy of
condemnation alike on economic and on moral grounds.</p>

<p>One further incident in connection with the general
question is worthy of notice. Mr. Harris says (<a href="#Page_200">p. 200</a>)
that a small number of the slaves now employed at San
Thomé are British subjects. There ought surely to be
no great difficulty in dealing with this class. African
experts would probably be able to say whether the claim
to British nationality was justified or the reverse. If
justified, it seems to me that the British Government
should send a ship to San Thomé, embark the men, and,
after having landed them at the most convenient ports
on the mainland, make suitable arrangements for despatching
them to their respective homes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>It has become the custom in recent years for writers,
particularly those recording their travels in semi-civilized
regions, to disclaim in advance any title to literary merit.
I do not propose to make any exception to this rule and
would plead in lieu of literary style a sincerity of
purpose, which I beg my literary critics and superiors
to accept. If they feel that the facts and incidents set
forth suffer from any lack of literary ability, I can only
hope that they will take the information supplied upon
some of the existing problems of West Africa and use it
in their own skilful way with the object of helping
forward the march of progress in West Central Africa.</p>

<p>The information contained in this book is drawn
from an experience of West Africa dating back to the
year 1898 and in particular during a recent journey of
something like 5000 miles through the western Equatorial
regions. The principal questions under review, are those
which affect in the main the conventional basin of the
Congo and the Colonies of the Gulf of Guinea.</p>

<p>It has always been my endeavour to get to know the
mind of natives and merchants outside the circle of
“the authorities,” a habit which I feel has sometimes
entailed the appearance of discourtesy, but I know how
reticent are the merchant communities, no less than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
native tribes, even the most untutored of them, if they
see a man or woman holding friendly relations with the
powers that be. This method of investigation I have
always pursued, with the result that information of the
utmost value has frequently been supplied. Whilst,
however, I have felt this to be the best course to follow
I have, at the same time, tried to place myself in the
position of a responsible minister of the Crown, a governor,
an official and even a planter, in order that so far as
possible I may look at things from their standpoint.</p>

<p>The question may be raised by some of my readers
how a man who has spent so many years of his life in
distinctly religious work can presume to write upon
commercial and political problems. I would make no
excuse for so doing, but in justification would say that
prior to preparation for missionary work, it is well-known
by many of my friends that I held a responsible position
in one of the leading commercial houses of the city of
London, which, amongst other advantages, gave me a large
insight into foreign and colonial questions. My experience
of the Congo and cognate questions early brought
me into touch with eminent statesmen and well-known
public men, including President Roosevelt, Lord Cromer,
Sir Edward Grey, Lord Fitzmaurice, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Sir Charles Dilke, Sir Francis Hyde Villiers,
Sir Arthur Hardinge, Sir Harry Johnston, Sir Valentine
Chirol, Mr. St. Loe Strachey, Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, and
my friends Travers Buxton, E. D. Morel and Harold
Spender. It is impossible to enjoy frequent discussions
with men of such breadth of knowledge, wide experience
and high ideals, without considerable profit, and at least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
some qualification for a responsible position. If there
is one to whom I am more deeply indebted than another,
it is to Lord Fitzmaurice, whose friendship and counsel
I have been privileged to enjoy in an increasing measure
for nearly twelve years.</p>

Editor of <i>Tropical Life</i>, the Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce, Messrs. John Holt, F. A. Swanzy and Elder
Dempster, for the information and help they have so
kindly supplied to me, and also to my wife for the
assistance rendered to me in the preparation of the

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD<br>
<span class="smaller">WEST AFRICA</span></h2>

</div>

<p>West Africa, as some of us have known her, is rapidly
changing. Within the memory of most men, there
were deserts uncrossed, forests unexplored, tribes of
people unknown. To-day every desert has been traversed;
to-day we know not only the forests, but nearly
every species of tree they contain; we know, and can
locate, almost every African tribe, and almost every foot
of territory has passed under the control, for the time
being at least, of some alien Power.</p>

<p>At the present moment political boundaries are more
or less fixed, but for how long? In Europe certain
Powers are, for one reason or another, seeking opportunities
somewhere for colonial expansion, and the
moment seems opportune for a reshuffle of colonial
possessions, but where, and how?</p>

<p>Looking into the Far East, the statesman sees nothing
but trouble ahead in the Celestial Empire, to say nothing
of Japan standing sentinel over the Orient. South
America, with its vast resources and possibilities, might
fall an easy prey to an energetic Power, but over every
Republic, Monroe casts his protective declaration which,
with the march of time, fastens itself ever more firmly
upon the vitals of the body politic of the Republican
States of South America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span></p>

<p>Back to Africa, the searching eye of the statesman
returns and rests to-day. There in the Dark Continent
are great territories awaiting development, there weak
administrations are “muddling along” doing themselves
no good, and their neighbours irreparable harm. For
those Powers the hand-writing is on the wall; they must
either “get on, or get out,” otherwise “like a whirlwind”
some other Power will come and without ceremony
bundle them out of the path of progress.</p>

<p>In fifty years the map of Africa will bear little
resemblance to that of to-day, but what of the natives?
Are they to have no voice in their destiny? One
listens with impatience to the cool and calculating discussions
for a re-arrangement of the map of Africa, which
are being carried on without any reference to the native
tribes, without any reference to treaty obligations, and
with little respect for the fundamental obligations of
Christianity, the teaching of which the European Powers
claim as their special monopoly.</p>

<p>Commerce, too, is changing; the kind-hearted merchant
of West Africa going forth at his own charges,
trudging from village to village founding branches,
paddling up and down the rivers and planting factories,
is disappearing, and the soulless corporation with directors
who are mere machines for registering dividends, are
taking his place. Commerce in West Africa is rapidly
losing all the humanity which was once its driving force.</p>

<p>The natives are abandoning the old forms of warfare.
Denied the weapons which would give them equal chances
in mortal gage, they are astute enough to refuse to accept
mere butchery. They are learning that there are powers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span>
mightier than the sword; education is advancing by
leaps and bounds, and the more virile colonies are producing
strong men who will make themselves felt before
many years have passed over our heads. The African
is shaking himself free from the shackles he has worn for
so long and is at last beginning to realize his strength.
At present Britain, with all her shortcomings, leads the
way in giving the native the fullest scope for his abilities.
In British and Portuguese Colonies alone in West Africa
has the free native the chance of attaining the full stature
of a man. In German and French tropical territories,
the native is there, not as a citizen, but merely as a
necessary adjunct to the production of wealth for the
white man. How long he will be content with this
position is a question, and evidences of a coming
change are everywhere apparent.</p>

<p>Soon the Africa we have known—yea, and loved—will
have been hustled away. Its forests, rivers and
tribes will possess no more secrets; gone will be the
simple old chief; gone the primitive village untouched
by European; gone the old witch doctor, and gone
too, perhaps, that beautiful faith and trust in the
goodness and honesty of the white man—the pity of
it all!</p>

<p>Before these changes come, it behoves us to examine
closely the great problems before us—the problems of
future political divisions, problems of labour, and of
education in the largest and fullest sense—and so to
readjust our conceptions and laws with an understanding
of the natives as save ourselves from repeating the
blunders of the past; blunders which have cost Africa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span>
millions of useful lives; blunders which have indelibly
stained for time and eternity the escutcheon of Christian
Europe; blunders for which recompense can never be
adequately made, but which at least should serve as a
warning for the future.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE AFRICAN “PORTER”</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It is almost impossible to exaggerate the part which the
African “porter” or carrier, plays in the history of the
Dark Continent. The hinterland of the vast tropical
regions—a death-trap to every beast of burden—has been
opened up by the carrier together with his brother transport
worker—the paddler. The heavier burden has,
beyond question, been borne by the former, by the
countless thousands of hard woolly heads which have
sweated under the weight of innumerable bales and
cases too often receiving as a reward of their labour
an endless stream of abuse. It seemed justifiable to
murmur when crossing those swamps and fighting one’s
way through impenetrable forest, but at a distance, and
with time for calm reflection, there can surely be no other
thought in the mind of any African traveller than that
of admiration, as he pictures those sons of Africa with
heavy and cumbersome loads upon their heads, floundering
through swamps, or toiling up steep hills and along
stony paths, cutting and blistering the feet, while the
fierce rays of the tropical sun scorch every living thing.
Yet on that carrier goes, footsore, often foodless, yet
ever ready to renew the march of to-morrow.</p>

<p>Railways and bridges, steamboats and bungalows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
engines of war, machinery for drilling into the bowels of
the earth, lofty windmills, telegraph wires and poles—these
and other European conquerors of African air, land
and water have by the thousands of tons found themselves
hundreds of miles in the interior of Africa owing to the
infinite endurance of the African carrier. Abuse him
who will, but be sure of one thing, history will yet give
him his due.</p>

<p>The railways, bridges and steamboats, would, so we
were told, lessen the need for carriers. That they have
shortened distances we grant, but so far from the need
of the carrier being lessened, economic expansion has
increased the demand. The opening up of the country
has brought an insatiable civilization into close touch
with vast uncultivated tracts of land, with the result
that a great impetus has everywhere been given to
agricultural development, which in turns calls for an
unceasing stream of carriers to feed the railways and
steam craft.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARRIER ON THE MARCH</div>

<p>Thirty years ago the British colony of the Gold Coast
possessed no railways, nor was there any export of cocoa.
To-day she exports annually over a million pounds’ worth
of cocoa-beans, requiring in the season over 100,000
carriers to convey the cocoa harvests to the railways.
True statesmanship must always aim at releasing labour
from the unproductive task of transport, in order that
it may till the soil, but it is doubtful whether the African
carrier will ever completely disappear.</p>

<p>Their long procession is never without interest; every
man has some distinguishing mark upon which the white
traveller may meditate as he trudges along, now in front,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
now in the centre, now again in the rear of a caravan.
What a medley yonder man carries upon his head!
There is the traveller’s “chop” box or his bundle of
bedding, to which perhaps is lashed by means of a
piece of forest vine, the sundry goods and chattels of
that simple-hearted carrier—an old salmon tin filled
with odd little packages of salt, chili peppers, bits of
string, possibly a piece of soap, an old knife and the end
of a native candle. There is also the “Sunday best,”
whose owner, while looking happy enough in that strip
of loin cloth held in place by a cheap European strap,
yet strides the firmer and prouder because of that old
cotton shirt and the patched white trousers so carefully
protected by a bundle of forest leaves. Provisions, too,
are there, carefully pounded, cooked and flavoured by
the good wife at home. Those unsavoury manioca
puddings for “her man” are generously accompanied
by her catches of fish, smoked and set aside that he
might each day have an appetizing morsel for his meal.</p>

  <p class="caption">THE CANOE SINGER.</p>
</div>

<p>Other carriers are distinguished by the wounds and
bruises of their calling—one limps along with a sore foot,
but on he goes until the journey’s end; others there
are with sore skin or nasty wounds, caused by forest
thorns or rough stones, others whose chafed shoulders of
yesterday now gape and become a resting-place for the
torment of flies; yet, with it all, the impatient traveller
too frequently falls to scolding and even cursing them
for their “laziness”!</p>

<p>No white man should be allowed to travel beyond a
day’s journey with a caravan unless he has a few medical
aids for such bruised and wounded helpers, and it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
repay him if human gratitude can be called a reward.
Cuts and wounds are both the inevitable price of African
travel, and it is a necessity and a duty to carry a few
spare bandages and healing ointments. There is satisfaction
too in gathering the sick men round in the evening
and giving them a soothing plaster, ointment or a bandage.
A little human kindness of this nature helps to make the
journey a happier one for all, but alas too often what
the Germans call <i>tropenkoller</i> has no conception of
a remedy for complaints beyond the whip or the boot.</p>

<p>The carrier is no more an angel than other human
beings, no matter whether pink or black; he has all the
imperfections and the love of self-preservation of the
brother who calls himself white. I remember once having
all the loads laid out ready for the start and then giving
the order for each man to choose his load. It was evident
the carriers had mentally marked the load each would
like to seize, for a dash was made for a small box only
about 18 inches square and having the appearance of a
20 lb. load—but it was a case of cartridges weighing
80 lbs.! How promptly they all discarded that box and
dashed away for the larger but lighter loads!</p>

<p>Strangely enough the carrier seldom “pilfers” on a
journey. The white man’s goods may suffer depredations
on the steamer or on the train, but on the march
there seems to be a sacred community of interest which
safeguards the goods of most white men as effectively as
if protected by the spirit-haunted herbs and parrot
feathers of the witch doctor, but when civilization, in the
shape of steamers and railway trains, enters barbarous
regions away goes the eighth commandment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
There is one respect in which every African traveller
invariably suffers—hungry at the mid-day hour, he calls
for “chop”; thirsty, he asks for filtered water; or at
night, dead tired, he looks for his folding bed; he may
call in vain, for either from set purpose with some
definite object in view, or from stupidity, these essentials
to the white man are generally “miles behind.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARRIER AND NATURE</div>

<p>Probably the carrier is at his best when travelling
through the vast forests, where, shielded from the sun by
the interlacing trees overhead, it is delightfully cool and
the layers of dried leaves render the path as soft and
springy as the richest carpet. Carriers and traveller are in
high mood and as conversation flows freely the traveller
realizes what great students of nature these sons of
Africa are. As they walk along, they will name every
tree and almost every plant; they will tell how many
moons elapse before the trees begin to bear; they will
give descriptions of edible fruits, the birds and animals
which each kind of fruit attracts, varying these running
comments by periodic dashes through the undergrowth
in search of fruits to illustrate the conversation.</p>

<p>How closely, too, they watch the path for the footprints
of animal life, never at a fault to identify the
prints with their owners, or accurately gauge the time
when the creature passed by, begging, if the traces are
recent, to be allowed to track the “meat.” As time
does not concern the hunter, it is generally wise, if there
is any reasonable chance of obtaining food for the caravan,
to camp for the night. This knowledge of forest life
stands the natives in good stead, for not infrequently
provisions run out on the long marches and in the absence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of human habitations, the question of feeding the caravan
becomes a serious matter.</p>

<p>At one time we had marched for days without any
opportunity of obtaining a supply of food and the carriers
were all suffering from hunger; in a whole day we seldom
found more than a small handful of edible fruit. At
last it became almost impossible to push on with the
caravan so tired and hungry: I called together a few of
the men and asked what we should do, whereupon one
made the novel suggestion of “calling the meat.” The
proposal was readily taken up and three of us pushed on
ahead with guns. Arriving at a quiet spot, one of the
men—a very son of the forest—fell on his knees, and,
placing the tips of two fingers in his nostrils, emitted a
series of calls which made that forest glen echo with,
as it were, the joyous cries of a troop of monkeys! How
anxiously the tops of trees were watched! After repeating
these tactics in several places in the immediate
vicinity for about half-an-hour, a man close to me
whispered excitedly “here they come”! In the distance
we could see the tree tops moving, and in a short time a
score of monkeys could be seen skipping from tree to
tree towards the inimitable monkey cries of our carrier.
New life was infused into the whole caravan when they
saw the gun bring down four monkeys for the evening
meal; lowering countenances were wreathed with smiles,
grumblings and cursings gave place to joyous songs in
which even the sick and lame gladly joined. At dinner
that night the men were so famished that they could not
stop to cook the meat, but contented themselves with
merely singeing off the skin and eating the uncooked flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARRIER’S FRIENDS</div>

<p>To emerge from the forest is generally to enter once
more into habitable country, and there the carriers, no
matter how far from home, generally discover a relative—a
brother or a sister, a father or a mother. Their
relationships are strangely elastic, many an African
laying claim to as many mothers as wives, in point of
fact the father’s brothers and the mother’s sisters all
rank as the fathers and mothers of the children. The
roving British tar may have a wife in every port, but
he is surpassed by the African carrier who may have not
only a wife but a mother and sometimes a father too in
every village!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PADDLER AND HIS CANOE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Central Africa, the unexplored land of our childhood,
is vested with a charm that never ceases to allure, and
reveals her deepest secrets only to those who dig deep
and risk much to discover them. The rivers with their
shifting sandbanks, their treacherous rapids and whirlpools,
entice again and again those whom the miasma
has threatened to slay, as the rushing current threatens
the unwary navigator. The native alone is in any
degree immune to the former, and it is he who, with his
simple knowledge of the shoals and currents, may venture
with his inimitable dug-out where scientific navigation
is baffled. Inseparable from the African river is the
dug-out, unthinkable are the thousands of miles of
navigable waterway without this primitive, though
astonishingly effective, craft.</p>

<p>Canoeing in Central Africa may be not unpleasant,
providing both canoe and paddlers are amiably inclined.
The number of canoes available is so restricted that
there is little choice, and comfort aside it is wise always
to sacrifice size to reputation, for a canoe with a bad
name will dispirit the paddlers. The trimmest and
most seasoned craft, capable of holding twenty to twenty-five
paddlers, is the traveller’s ideal, but the equipment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
is incomplete without a small pilot boat for surplus
baggage, manned with four or five paddlers, who will
keep ahead, but always in sight, forewarning of rocks,
snags, or sandbanks, and generally discharging the
functions of a scout. No less important is the selection
of the crew, and these to complete a harmonious group
should be volunteers—the best plan being that of getting
three or four cheery spirits to select the remainder from
amongst their friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PADDLER AND MUSIC</div>

<p>The African paddler readily responds to an appeal
for a co-operative canoe journey, but he dislikes any
such undertaking as a mere hired paddler. Make him
part and parcel of the journey and a host of potential
difficulties vanish. Erect in the bows of the canoe a
tiny rush shelter with a bamboo bed for the white man,
and only the two final though most important elements
remain—music and provisions—the absence of either
being equally fatal. For the latter, an ample supply of
dried fish and cassava can be stored in the canoe, while
a currency in the shape of beads, salt, cloth, pins and
needles will do the rest. Without music the African can
neither live nor die, nor yet be buried; walking, riding,
eating, digging, paddling or dancing, he must have the
rhythm of his music, devoid of charm it may be to the
European, but vital to the good spirits of the African.
To the accompaniment of an old biscuit tin or a couple
of sticks, the gunwale of the canoe, or the leaves of the
forest, any or all of which can be made to give forth a
sufficiency of barbaric sounds to set in rhythmic motion
the voices and bodies of all within range.</p>

<p>With canoe packed, paddlers in position with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
long spear-shaped paddles and musicians with their
instruments, provisions piled high and carefully covered,
the start is made. Farewells are shouted, and blessings
pronounced which if measured by their volume should
preserve the traveller for all time from hippos and snags,
storms and mosquitos, sickness, accident and even
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CANOE CHARACTERISTICS</div>

<p>One sees in the African canoe characteristics as
distinct as those of the paddlers, for with a limited companionship
comes a close acquaintance with nature and
things inanimate. There is the leviathan among native
craft shaped by the chief and his followers from a forest
giant and bearing herself with the proud consciousness
of regal ownership. In such a craft the passengers need
have no fear for she rides majestically with her bows
reared high, breasting the waves of the tornado-lashed
river or lake, unmoved by the raging of the elements.
She is seen at her best as she glides down stream under
the combined influence of the current and the swinging
impetus of her thirty stout paddlers. There is the
rickety old canoe with broken stern and crippled sides,
and her leaking bottom stuffed with clay, but there is
life in her yet. She ships water fore and aft, and amidships
too, soaking the traveller’s blankets and provisions,
but her long experience gives her an ease in travel which
her younger though stouter relatives cannot rival.
Then there is the lumbering ungainly dug-out, with
crooked nose and knotty sides, unreliable and ill-balanced,
possessing an affinity for every submerged snag. “Hard
on” she frequently goes and every effort to free her
threatens to drown the occupants. Sandbanks she seeks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
out too and obstinately refuses to “jump” them. The
paddlers will haul her off and curse her roundly for her
crooked ways,—but as she was hewn so she will remain.
At the other end of the scale is the tiny fishing dug-out
of the Niger and the Congo, and their still smaller sister
of Batanga in Spanish Guinea, the latter so small that
the owner may with ease carry on his shoulder both
canoe and fishing tackle, and whilst baiting hooks and
catching fish he skilfully sits astride her and paddles
with his feet.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus05.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">A RICKETY DUG-OUT.</p>
</div>

<p>Inseparable again from the dug-out is the paddler.
Who that travelled with him can forget him? Humorous
as the London Jehu of the twentieth century, dexterous
as his civilized confrères of the ocean, as adaptable to his
surroundings as the clay to the potter’s art; at home
everywhere and in all conditions in his native land,
swimming or standing, sitting or lying, squatting or
reclining, sleeping as soundly on the nose of the canoe or
the river bank as we in our downiest of feather beds.
He is ready and alert with the earliest peep of dawn, as
the mists rise from the surface of the river, presenting
the appearance of a huge boiling cauldron. Peeping
from beneath your mosquito net you see his figure outlined
against the dawning light as he keeps a sharp look-out
for the hidden snag, and shivers with the clinging chilly
mist. His powers of endurance are unequalled, as the
rising sun dispels the mists and mounting higher in the
heavens becomes increasingly fierce. He still swings
his paddle with steady persistence till his body steams
with the effort; then after a little halt and refreshment
in the friendly shade of the riverside forest, he will go on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
until the sun is sinking, and if need be, still on in the
moonlight, singing his monotonous boat song, occasionally
varied by a running commentary from the leader on the
incidents of the journey, the peculiarities of a certain
paddler, or the ways of the white occupants of the canoe.</p>

<p>During the whole day long the paddler will pursue
his task, I see him now almost unconsciously bending
his body with each dip of the paddle, till a sudden slowing
down followed by a profound stillness arrests the attention.
I can again hear those whispered voices as the
gentle lapping of the water against the canoe side ceases,
and the boat is still. A monkey has perhaps been seen
overhead springing from bough to bough, or sitting
nibbling the fruit of some forest tree, or it may be an
edible bird with flesh as tough as its plumage is gorgeous,
that watches us till the gun booms out and the creature
is brought down. For a moment it struggles in the river,
then with a sudden splash, a man is swimming with
powerful strokes towards the prey which he a moment
later lands in the canoe, while the rest look approvingly
on at their prospective meal. With spirits heartened,
on they go, singing of their capture and the feast which
is to follow, till turning a bend in the river the destination
is at last in sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CANOE RACE</div>

<p>And how they love a race! Let them but see a
competitor ahead bound for the same goal, and despite
their long day’s paddle they will redouble their strokes.
Caution is thrown to the winds and the canoe springs
in a mad gallop, rocking to and fro, pitching and tossing
against the current until the rival ahead, scenting a race,
enters the competition with keen zest. At such times I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
have found all warnings are in vain. With a rapid
girding up of the loin cloths as the boats proceed, a rearranging
of the cargo, children, dogs, fowls, baggage
and all—the race begins in real earnest. With much
shouting and good-natured banter the one or the other
will take advantage of every prospect of an up-current;
now out again in midstream to avoid a snag; a paddle
breaks in the effort, but is quickly discarded and another
seized without lessening the speed—and on they go, each
determined to win or sink their rival. The boats ship
water, but are made to right themselves with marvellous
ingenuity and then both stop to bale out, while the
paddlers exchange good-humoured threats, gibes, curses
and defiance.</p>

<p>On again they go with little advantage to either side,
and the word is passed for the “master stroke.” Madder
than ever is the race; the white man may shout but
they pay no heed, for young manhood has lost all sense
of danger. At last the opportunity occurs for the final
advantage for the river must be crossed at yonder point.
Often have I tried to avoid this danger, proceeding first
to command, then to plead, but in vain. I might as
effectively have tried to control a hurricane with a
feather! To clear the point with its snags, one canoe
must fall behind or cross the rival’s bows—to give up
and fall back is impossible. The attempt is generally
made by the smaller boat to cross the bows of her more
powerful rival and though occasionally successful she is
more often struck amidships and disappears completely—canoe,
paddlers and all!</p>

<p>A great shout goes up and the victors splash in to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the rescue, seizing the mats, baskets, provisions and
sundries, which float off in every direction. The crew,
as much at home in the water as on land, come up one
by one and others dive to seize the stern of the sunken
canoe. With vigorous pulling and pushing, the water is
swished out till she floats again, and in the vanquished
spring, again baling out the remaining water with their
feet, till it is once more fit for occupation, and every one
is prepared for the last lap of the journey. The men
take their beating well, enjoying the laugh against themselves.
That night all sleep together in a friendly fishing
encampment, while the white man curls up in his canoe,
and listens to the merry paddlers as they recount with
evident enjoyment the story of their five-mile race.</p>

<p>Who that has found a home and nightly shelter in an
African canoe will not, as he quits it after many days,
feel that he is leaving an old acquaintance behind him.
Through the twenty-four hours of sleeping and waking,
the canoe and the traveller have adapted themselves to
each other’s limitations, and the recently vacated canoe
speaks as eloquently of emptiness as the vacant chair.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="I_III">III<br>
<span class="smaller">THE AFRICAN FOREST</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There can hardly be any experience more exquisitely
luxurious than that of wandering on through the primeval
forests of Central Africa. The traveller whose daily
round confines him to the great cities of a hustling
civilization finds himself in perfect solitude, perhaps for
the first time in his life. Every step he takes brings
before him some new wonder in nature’s garden; every
hour in the day is alive with fresh experiences.</p>

<p>Surely there is no language which aptly befits the
transcendent beauty of nature awaking to greet the new-born
day. During the night, giant forms have roamed
at will through the silent glades and recesses of the
forests, but with the peep of day they have retired to
their lair. Those feathered sentinels, whose hoarse cry
rings through the night hours, have perforce veiled their
eyes at the awakening of their comrades who strike the
sweeter chords befitting the glad hours of day. Throughout
the night the trees made monotonous music by the
incessant drip drip of their tears, but with the morning,
the warm sun has bidden those tears begone.</p>

<p>When daylight breaks through the tree tops, the
boughs sway here and there as the monkeys, springing
from tree to tree, gambol with their fellows, only ceasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
for a momentary peep at the strange intruders of their
sylvan preserve, as the undergrowth crackles beneath
the travellers’ feet and the squirrels dart across the
pathway seeking a safer retreat. The sight of the white
clad figure, moving rapidly through the mass of undergrowth,
startles the mother bird from her nest, and off
she goes shrieking for her mate and warning her fellows.
Yet over all, a silence broods and the traveller falls to
constant musing as he wends his way.</p>

<p>For miles the dense forests will shut out the sun, and
then perhaps where a lofty giant tree has fallen in decay,
a slanting ray of sun will gleam through the leafy roof
turning the pathway into a smiling track of iridescent
moss and fern. A few yards further and the path
descends abruptly into a woodland stream, bridged by
rustic logs, only possible of fording in mid-current by
creeping warily along the trunk of a tree which some
thoughtful passer-by has felled. The logs and trees
which lie rotting in all directions are the home of shimmering
mosses and tiny fern. Beside the slippery and
tottering causeway there shines many a filigree globe of
purest opal and cunning design like a fairy’s incandescent
light guiding the steps of the unwary traveller. They
are but insects’ nests, as fragile as delightsome, crumbling
at the touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BUSY ANTS</div>

<p>The traveller can never proceed many miles on his
journey without meeting the dark lines of driver ants.
At a distance of fifty yards, all one sees is a uniform
brown line, sometimes two inches wide, sometimes as
many feet. Drawing nearer they are seen to be well-ordered
regiments, thousands strong, with scouts, baggage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
bearers, captains and field-marshals. Their enemies
have fled at their approach and they are masters of the
field. On they will march, in faultless array, their
countless thousands obediently passing at a double their
immovable field-marshals, and as they proceed every
living thing flees before them. Now perhaps they disappear
through some subterranean passage, tunnelled out
by their indomitable energy, to reappear on the surface
when it suits their plan. You may scatter them if you
dare, but you can daunt them never. Sweep them into
heaps, kill them by the hundred, burn them by the
thousand, and tens of thousands surge forward, to fill up
the ranks, and remove the dead. Then the regiments will
grimly move once more on their way—an incentive to
higher organisms.</p>

  <p class="caption">WILD FOREST FRUIT.</p>
</div>

<p>The African forests teem with life, for the most part
silent; even the great beasts glide along in perfect
quietude—not till you are upon them do you realize
the proximity of the elephants; then, unless the
traveller be a Nimrod, his greatest concern is to avoid a
possible encounter. They love most a quiet glen near
the forest stream, where they will plough the earth in all
directions and everywhere leave the impress of their
giant limbs stretched in gymnastics all their own; here
and there scattered over their playground lie scores of
trees athwart each other, evidence of no woodman’s axe,
but of the entwining grip of the monster’s trunk, who in
his unrivalled strength delights thus to shew his power
in his own domain. Everywhere, too, the great forest
apples lie idle after their sport, and the natives tell how
they spend hours hurling these great balls at their fellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>The rivers which everywhere feed the African forest,
coupled with the tropical sun, give luxuriance to all
nature. Vines are there as much as three feet in circumference,
moss-grown and gnarled with age, born perhaps
when the parent acorns of our oldest oaks were yet unformed.
Sometimes like huge serpents they coil themselves
in a tortuous grip round two or three trees, each
of which may be ten times their own size.</p>

<p>There is beauty too in these silent forests, when
at intervals on the march the traveller, almost unconsciously
at first, begins to inhale the fragrant odour of
some delicious perfume sent forth by modest blooms that
shun the gaze of man. A little searching beneath the
undergrowth, or in the tree tops overhead, reveals a
bloom upon which the eye gladly lingers—trails of
waxen jasmine hanging from the bush in exquisite
profusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEAUTY IN DECAY</div>

<p>There is beauty, too, in the forest decay, in the fallen
tree trunk, whose rotting bark and ugly torn stump are
transformed by tufts of gracefully drooping fern, while
tiny rootlets smile from out every crevice. There is
beauty, too, in the fungus growths, tinted and white, or
the perfection of coral, or blooms whose purple depths
suggest some cherished hot-house flower.</p>

<p>The experienced traveller is quick to note signs of
a change; the pathway leads uphill and the absence of
giant tree trunks denotes that he is treading a once cleared
and populated region. That hill, whose summit is capped
with foliage, was once a village landmark, beneath it,
myriad termites live and pursue their daily toils through
tunnels and chambers that they have shaped by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
countless thousands. Were man’s three-score years and
ten twice told devoted to the study of the ways and
purposes of the unheeded occupants of our earth, he had
but then begun to learn the alphabet of nature’s infinite
resources.</p>

<p>Close to the termite hills the half-buried foundations
of primitive dwellings speak of departed life, and in the
Congo, hundreds, yea thousands, of these mark the spot
where once the children of nature lived out their simple
life, till civilization strode through the land treading
ruthlessly down the souls of men. They have gone and
their haunts lie deserted, but their monuments remain.
The discarded kernels of the housewives’ palm nuts have
taken root and now rear their graceful fronds on faultless
trunks like capitals of Corinthian pillars in some
cathedral aisle. As if by design they ranged themselves
thus. In these silent groves the traveller treads
reverently upon the grassy floor; no monk is here;
there is no echo of the choristers’ song, but nature has
reared her temple where myriad voices rejoice and sing
their song of praise, unfettered by the forms and creeds
of man.</p>

<p>The long day’s tramp is now over; the sun is setting
and the birds are carolling their evening song, as the
traveller emerges into the open space beside the gleaming
river, flowing swiftly onwards with its errand to the sea.
The glow of the departing sun tints the clouds with purple
and gold outshining in glory the loveliness of the morning.
Surely the heavenly regions are not far beyond, and this
is a glimpse behind the veil. The afterglow has departed
and the world of man falls asleep till the twittering of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>

<span class="smaller">A MEDLEY OF CUSTOMS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>A lifetime spent amongst a single African tribe would
scarcely exhaust its folklore and customs. Awaiting
scientific investigation there is throughout the African
continent a wealth of lore and superstition.</p>

<p>To him who would discover the hidden life of the
African infinite patience is essential. It is useless to
force information; the best plan is to wait until the
“spirit moves” the old woman or chief to tell you
something of the inner life of the tribe. Perhaps the
time and conditions which most contribute to a flow of
talk are a moonlight evening around the log fires and
cooking pots.</p>

<p>I see them now—these simple Africans, seated around
the great earthenware pot awaiting the meal of boiled
cassava, pounded leaves or steamed Indian corn. I hear
that grey-headed old chief, with low musical voice,
passing on the traditions of past generations, so “that
the boys may know something of the early history of
their race.” All the old stories familiar to civilization
are there. They all know that “man first went wrong
through woman gathering fruit in the forest,” the only
variation is that the kind of fruit differs in different
parts of West Africa, but it is always a forest fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
always the woman tempted the man; always man
succumbed! Then the old chief will turn to the oft-told
story—the sacrificial efficacy of the young kid. It is
remarkable how closely this custom resembles even to-day
that institution of the Pentateuch. The young kid must
be free from all disease, a perfect animal in every respect.
When killed the blood is carefully sprinkled on the lintel
and on each door-post. Other familiar sacred institutions
are passed under review. Then the animal kingdom
comes under discussion, and the whole series of Uncle
Remus, with but slight variations, secures the rapt
attention of the listeners. It is at such times as these
that the student gets beneath the surface of polygamy,
burial and marriage dances, cicatrization and the more
serious subjects of land tenure, tribal laws, social ties and
domestic slavery.</p>

<p>Not all tribes are equally interesting, probably the
Baketi tribes on the upper reaches of the Kasai river
provide the greatest wealth of interesting customs and
folklore. Their grotesque images, carved in wood, grin
at the traveller from the door-posts of the houses, and
passing through the villages one has to be extremely
careful not to tread upon one of the fetishes which are
scattered along the walks in great profusion. One day
I saw three separate fetishes within a single square yard,
and these, the father explained to us in his simple way, he
had purchased at, to him, a heavy cost, hoping thereby
to restore to health his only daughter. Not only does
the Baketi fill his town with fetishes and wooden images,
but in the forests which separate village from village,
almost every tree along the pathway has rudely carved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
on its trunk the grinning face of some impossible human
being.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BAKETI FETISH</div>

<p>The Baketi, too, is probably unique in his memorial
grounds. Most African tribes bury the dead in the heart
of the forest, but at the same time near the village a
memorial ground is set apart on which are erected tiny
memorial huts, which the restless spirits of the departed
may inhabit if they so choose. There, when the spirit
pays such visits—as all good spirits do nightly—he finds
his loin cloth ready, the spoon with which he ate his
food, the bottle from which he drank, his battle axe and
cross bow which played havoc in many an affray; there
is generally too a spread of Indian corn or other food,
which the thoughtful and sorrowing wives have placed
in readiness for his return visit to earth. How safe these
memorial tombs are from desecration may be gathered
from the fact that very frequently considerable sums of
native currency are strewn upon the floor. These little
tombs are also surrounded with numerous carved images
erected on poles. The Baketi have another custom which
is, I believe, quite unique in West Central Africa. Outside
every village are large forest clearings covered with
grass, and dotted over these meadow-like lands may be
seen the strange sight of trees rooted up and planted
upside down—the branches having been lopped off or
the tree trunk cut through the middle and planted with
the roots in the air. The sight of these clearings, involving
a considerable expenditure of labour, covered
with scores—sometimes hundreds—of these symbolic
monuments, is most impressive.</p>

<p>The Baketi have elaborate ceremonials at births and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
marriages. A special house is always built for the birth
of a child, the mother being conveyed to the dwelling an
hour or so before the expected time, as is likewise the
case with a dying person. Another curious custom which
prevails amongst these people, and strangely enough we
found precisely the same custom a thousand miles north
amongst the Ngombe tribes of Bopoto, yet nowhere in
the intervening territories, forbids any young woman to
definitely enter into marriage relations until one end of
the interior of her house is closely packed with neatly
cut logs of firewood! This usually means about three
hundred logs, measuring eighteen inches in length and
two feet in circumference. The idea appears to be that
of demonstrating the domestic capacity of the bride-elect.</p>

<p>With every West African tribe there are customs
peculiar to the individual community, but they are
generally trivial, or variations of customs prevailing
amongst the surrounding tribes. Amongst Congo tribes
only the Baketi apparently possess customs so completely
unique.</p>

<h4 id="I_IV_a">(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">Cicatrization</span></h4>

<div class="sidenote">CICATRIZATION</div>

<p>Cicatrizing is practised more or less over the whole
of West Central Africa. In some parts like the Bangalla
and Equatorial regions of the Congo, the patterns are
extremely elaborate and involve much patient labour on
the part of the artist and prolonged suffering by the
individual.</p>

  <p class="caption">THE OYSTER SHELL CICATRICE.</p>
</div>

<p>Cicatrizing is often confounded with tattooing, but
the latter process is entirely different, and is of course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
most largely in vogue amongst the Maoris and seafaring
men. The word cicatrization is derived from the French
medical term which designates the scars left by a healed
wound and implies a raised portion of the flesh, whereas
tattooing is an indentation coupled with the insertion of
indelible dyes. Strangely enough the Baluba tribes south
of the Congo tattoo themselves, and in this respect are
unique in West Africa. Both men and women readily
subject themselves to the cicatrizing knife, but generally
speaking women are more liberally marked than men.</p>

<p>In the Bangalla regions of the Congo, the facial
markings resemble the surface of a coarse rasp, whilst
the women content themselves with large shell patterns
on the lower part of the stomach. Along the main Congo
and some of the tributaries, the marking which finds
most favour is the “coxcomb” in the centre of the
forehead; this is sometimes cut quite deeply. The
hinterland tribes of the Equatorial rivers almost without
exception adopt the oyster shell pattern just below the
temple, but the women, in addition, are prodigally
marked with “knobs,” small “oyster shells” and “bead
strings” all over the body, particularly on the thighs.
Amongst the Batetela, the forearm is usually covered
with a pattern identical with the Cornish “one and all”
motto, often also with a sunflower pattern running from
the navel up to the shoulder, sometimes to the right, but
more often to the left. In the Kasai territories there is
first the one general cicatrice imposed on the people by
the historic northern conqueror Wuta, a “white” chieftain
of prodigious valour and energy, who, apparently
more than five hundred years ago, swept through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
whole region founding new dynasties and placing the
tribes under tribute of soldiers and money. This hustling
personage, it is said, reached what is now Rhodesia, but
so great was, and is, the fear of his spirit that everyone
to-day bears his cicatrice. The Bakuba, Bashilele, Baketi,
Bushongos and Lulua, all bear their distinctive
marks, many of the women having the whole thigh
covered with a “herring bone,” and the men carrying a
mark similar to the Grecian “key” pattern. In the
Portuguese Enclave and the Mayumbe territory of the
Congo, the whole of the back is frequently covered by a
single pattern and on the back of one woman we found a
marking which is clearly the Swastika.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARTIST IN BLOOD</div>

<p>The operation is, of course, distinctly painful. The
subject sits on the ground or on a log of wood, whilst the
operator cuts deeply into the flesh with the knife held at
such an angle that a considerable wound will result.
Think of sitting still whilst this crude hand-made piece
of native steel is dug into the flesh something like twenty
or thirty times within half an hour! Once I was able
to watch the process; the woman desired a “lace
pattern” made from the shoulder blades to the waist,
involving altogether four lines, which meant nearly two
hundred cuts. She sat outside her hut, and bending
down slightly to stretch the skin, the intended pattern
was marked in chalk, and then the operator, taking his
small cicatrizing knife in his right hand, proceeded to
grasp between the thumb and forefinger of the left
successive small portions of flesh, gashing each till the
blood flowed freely. Then he started the other side of
the body, returning again to cut the third line, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
back to the second to link the pattern up with the
fourth.</p>

<p>I watched the woman closely, and as the knife dipped
into the flesh she made a grimace, but between the cuts,
laughingly and with considerable spirit replied to my
comments. At the conclusion of the operation, she
calmly walked to the nearest tree and gathered a few
leaves to wipe up the blood which by this time was streaming
down her body. The operator, according to custom,
threw over the wounds a handful of powdered camwood
which, however, has less antiseptic than drying properties.</p>

  <p class="caption">THE BANGALLA “RASP” CICATRICE.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not easy to light upon such operations, which are
generally carried out more or less privately, and in all
my years of residence in Africa, this was the only occasion
on which I have been able to watch throughout an
elaborate cicatrization. It is, however, a familiar sight
to meet natives with their bodies newly cut. On the
day after the incisions have been made the wounds swell
and suppurate, greatly to the delight of the hosts of
insect life which swarm everywhere in Central Africa.
These surround the wounded body of the native and only
by a continuous flicking of grass or twig brushes can the
suffering victim obtain even comparative freedom from
the tortures which every movement of the body imposes,
but in the course of a few months the pattern originally
cut in the body stands out firm and clear. In those
cases where still more emphatic designs are desired, the
cicatrice will be re-opened and raised higher still until
the prominence is quite pronounced, in others, after a
lapse of a few months, still more lines and still more
“knobs” will be added until the age of twenty to thirty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
After this the desire for adornment ceases and the body
rests from its tortures.</p>

<p>What is it that attracts? What power is it which
buoys up the spirit under these painful operations?
What is the secret which gives this insatiable desire for
fleshy adornment?—a desire firmly rooted in the breast
of every section of the community and shared by young
and old alike. I well remember an orphan child, of
about three summers, standing in the roadway crying
bitterly, and upon my asking the cause, she told me that
being an orphan no one had enough interest in her to
cut a “coxcomb” on her forehead. Secreting a small
bottle of red ink, I told her to sit on the table, and by a
series of pinchings and finger-nail marks on her forehead,
coupled with a smearing of red ink over my white hands,
calmed the little mite into the belief that her heart’s
desire was being gratified. After about ten minutes she
was supremely happy in the thought that she too possessed
a “coxcomb.” Her delight was unbounded, until the
little mischief caught sight of her natural forehead in a
mirror!</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARRIAGE AND TRIBAL MARKINGS</div>

<p>No doubt the principal motive for this passion is the
love of personal adornment, of which the African assuredly
does not retain a monopoly. Hitherto the hinterland
tribes have had no access to those artificial aids to personal
adornment, which are laid so temptingly before the youth
of civilization. They will tell you they have had no
alternative but to “adorn” their only garb—nature’s
dusky skin, and none would deny, that there is a certain
beauty even in these barbarous forms of embellishment.
The critic may observe that the beauty of womanhood is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
obviously not enhanced by the bold use of the cicatrizing
knife, but I would remind that critic that the wife without
a body fairly well covered with cicatrization finds but
scant favour with the other sex. In Africa the European
youths of fashion have their counterpart, and in the
direction of the most daintily cicatrized maiden, are cast
the most amorous glances, and offers of handsome dowries
to the admiring parents for the hand of their captivating
daughter.</p>

<p>Other reasons doubtless play a part, among them the
question of tribal ownership of wives, and the necessity
of placing a distinctive and indelible mark upon the
body. Constant internecine warfare, too, demanded a
mark which would make easy the task of discriminating
the warriors of the respective combatants.</p>

<p>Patriotism, relationship and love of adornment, combine
in giving to the African the extraordinary fortitude
which this prolonged operation demands, but the disappearance
of internal warfare, the increasing importation
of cheap jewellery and gaudy clothing, and the
advance of Christian civilization, is robbing this custom
of its <i>raison d’être</i>, and in another generation the little
African boys and girls will only learn from books of this
curious custom of their grandfathers and grandmothers,
for cicatrization, as practised to-day, will have perished
within another twenty-five years.</p>

<h4 id="I_IV_b">(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">Personal Adornment</span></h4>

<p>Left to nature, the African, dissatisfied with his personal
charms, looks about him for some means for adding
adornment to his body. In the absence of finely woven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
cloths and silks, he covers his person with ornamental
markings, and his woolly hair he makes to take the place
of head-gear. In two respects only his tastes accord
with those of the European—metal ornaments and
rouge powder.</p>

<p>Most African tribes wear some cloth. The wild
Ngombe on the southern banks of the main Congo, skilled
in ironwork but ignorant of weaving, wear a vegetable
cloth which they strip from the inner side of the coarse
bark of a forest tree. Many of their women content
themselves with only a few cicatrized patterns, and this is
most noticeable in the hinterland of Bangalla, north of
the Congo. A peculiar feature, however, is that all these
women, though completely nude, wear a thin piece of
string round the loins. When photographing a group,
I suggested the removal of these strings, because they
seemed to imply that normally a cloth or leaf was thereby
suspended; but the women, at this, to me, most innocent
suggestion, all became exceedingly angry and threatened
to run away. Finally, I managed to restore good relations,
and we succeeded in obtaining an excellent photograph.
It was evident that some deep significance attached to
wearing this almost invisible cord, but what that significance
was I could not discover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAIRDRESSING</div>

<p>Hairdressing ranks almost equal in importance with
cicatrization, and practically any day the traveller
passing through the villages may see some native stretched
lazily upon a mat on the ground, the head resting on the
lap of the hairdresser—generally one of the opposite sex.
In Spanish Guinea, and on the islands off Batanga, the
style of hairdressing is that of long plaits, sometimes a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
dozen in number, running out in all directions from the
top of the head. In French and Belgian Congo the
style most favoured is the helmet and in some cases the
mitre form; in these the hair is braided up until it adds
apparently about five or six inches to the stature. In
many parts of the Cameroons, as well as in French and
Belgian Congo, the hair thus built up is covered with a
mixture of oil and camwood powder, and thus offers a
solid protection against the fierce rays of the tropical
sun.</p>

  <p class="caption">BANGALLA BABE WITH HEAD TIGHTLY BOUND.</p>
</div>

<p>Amongst the Boela people of Bangalla, the custom
prevails of binding the crown of an infant’s head with
tough cord soon after birth, and this head-binding is
maintained throughout life. The effect is that of an
elongated or sugar-loaf skull which is greatly emphasized
when the hair is prominently braided around it. We
observed men of all ages with their heads bound in this
manner, but they did not appear to suffer any discomfort,
and the mental powers of the tribe were in no sense below
the average.</p>

<p>Rouge finds great favour in the personal adornment
of the African. The powder is obtained from the camwood
tree, and in almost every well-regulated household
in the forest regions may be seen let into the ground a
log of wood some eighteen inches in diameter, while a
piece of smaller dimensions lies near at hand. The
housewife, in order to obtain the colouring, rubs—or
more correctly grinds—one piece on the other, which,
with the aid of either water or oil, causes a thick red paste
to exude, which is then made into cones and placed in
the sun. When thoroughly dry, it is either pressed into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
a powder and sprinkled over the body, or the person is
anointed with a mixture of the powder and palm oil;
in either case imparting a bright red appearance.</p>

<p>In war times, at festivals, and on feast days, an
enormous amount of rouge is used, and the red bodies
of the tribes are rendered extremely grotesque by the
addition of white clay markings which stand out very
clearly on the red background.</p>

  <p class="caption">STYLES OF ARUWIMI HEAD-DRESS.</p>
</div>

<p>For the most part the West African tribes extract all
the hair from the body with the exception of the head,
the beard and moustache. The task is almost a daily
one, and in the case of a man is generally undertaken by
one or more of his wives. Little boys and girls submit
willingly to the removal of their eyebrows and eyelashes.</p>

<p>Brass anklets and necklaces are much prized by the
natives throughout West Africa. The Mongo tribes of
the Congo wear anklets weighing sometimes 10 pounds
on each ankle, and the whole set of ornaments, including
the collar, will turn the scale at 35 pounds. In the
Leopoldian régime these valuable ornaments were a contributory
cause to the atrocities, for the rubber soldiery
would always seek out the women in possession of such
anklets and collars, and, as they were welded on the body,
would not hesitate to chop off the foot, the hand, or
even the head in order to obtain the ornaments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRICE OF ADORNMENT</div>

<p>I once heard a neat retort from an African woman.
The questioner was a white lady who had been pointing
out the pain caused by wearing these heavy articles of
adornment. The dialogue ran as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>White Woman</i>: Why do you wear anklets which cause
you so much pain?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
<i>African Woman</i>: Beauty is worth pain.</p>

<p><i>White Woman</i>: Surely you do not suffer such torture
in order to appear beautiful?</p>

<p><i>African Woman</i>: Tell me then, white woman, why do
you suffer pain by tying yourself so tightly in the waist,
like a woman suffering the pangs of hunger?</p>

</div>

<p>How far these simple customs should be checked
has always seemed to me a matter of doubt, but in the
internal government of missions they cause serious
dissensions among the staff. Not a few missionaries,
and some government officials, seem to feel called upon
to place these old-time customs almost on the level of
criminal offences.</p>

<p>In one mission no natives may sit down to Holy
Communion with their hair braided and oiled, nor may
they enjoy the full privileges of Church membership if
they use camwood powder on their bodies; this is the
more outrageous when, within a few days’ canoe journey,
there is another Christian mission where one lady
missionary at least is evidently well acquainted with the
use of delicately scented rouge. In another mission,
cicatrizing, the extraction of the eyelashes, men dressing
the hair of women or vice versâ, are sufficient to warrant
suspension from Church membership.</p>

<p>In all conscience there is enough that is evil in
humanity, both white and coloured, to make the decalogue
sufficiently hard of attainment, without human agencies
arbitrarily introducing non-essentials which make it
grievous to be borne.</p>

<h4 id="I_IV_c">(<i>c</i>) “<span class="smcap">The Angel of Death</span>”</h4>

<div class="sidenote">THE DEATH OF THE AFRICAN</div>

<p>The wildness of the African hinterland, the frequency
of bloody feuds, the ever present unhealthiness, almost
daily materializes the hand of death. From the moment
the traveller touches the coast of Sierra Leone, he is
never far from the tragedy of early and violent deaths,
accounts of which reach him at every port.</p>

<p>The native’s fear of death is immortalized in his
many boat songs, his legends and traditions, as well as in
those elaborate systems of fetishism which are used to
ward off the imaginary proximity of Death’s angel.</p>

<p>This was the feature of African life which so impressed
Du Chaillu on his first visit to West Africa. “Are you
ready for death?” he sometimes asked the natives.
“No,” would be the hasty reply, “never speak of that,”
and then, says Du Chaillu, “a dark cloud settled on the
poor fellow’s face; in his sleep that night he had
horrid dreams, and for a few days he was suspicious
of all about him, fearing for his poor life lest it should
be attacked by a wizard.”</p>

<p>Cursing in West Africa, which almost invariably
takes the form of invoking death upon some relative,
is one of the most frequent causes of trouble. A curse
hurled at himself, the African merely resents, and returns
the compliment, but let a man invoke death upon
another’s mother or sister, and the dagger leaps instantly
from its scabbard, or the spear goes hurtling through the
air with deadly precision.</p>

<p>“May you die” is the most common form of cursing,
which brings the sharp retort, “And you also.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
curses, “May the leopard catch your mother,” “May
the crocodile eat your sister,” call forth instant battle.
The explanation of this strong resentment and intensity of
feeling is found in the fact that the African firmly believes
that when a curse is pronounced the unfortunate person
is thereby accursed.</p>

<p>No man ever goes on a journey, no matter how short,
without a string of charms about his neck, to ward off
the grim form of death, which he believes lurks in every
forest, along every river, in every home. There is one
charm to protect from violent death through wild animals,
there is one to protect from death at the hands of
strangers, but chiefest of all is that little charm stuffed
away in the ram’s horn, which is a perfect safeguard
against the death curse of strangers whom the traveller
may meet when on his way from village to village.</p>

<p>The traveller cannot escape the sorrow and despair
of death which surely is nowhere so marked as at the
death of the African. For days, maybe, the sufferer
has lain without any perceptible change, either for better
or worse; then, perhaps, the watcher observes a sign
which shews that the end is not far off, and the word goes
round the village that Bomolo cannot live long.</p>

<p>Silently, one after another, the relatives creep into
the hut and sit upon cooking pots, mats, stools and
logs of wood, until the hut is filled with men and women
knit together with a common sorrow. The strong man
they have remembered in the sylvan chase, the keen
fisherman, or possibly the courageous warrior they have
known and admired, and in their beautiful simplicity
loved, is stretched upon the hard bamboo bed which his
busy hands had made. The watchers can see that it is
only a matter of hours and the general weeping is at first
silent, occasionally ceasing when the sick one speaks
or calls for something. The nearer relatives rub and
bathe the limbs which begin to chill; one or two
affectionately hold a foot, a hand, or a finger; the
favourite wife, as her right and duty, tenderly nurses
the head.</p>

<p>In proportion as the weakness increases, the crying
becomes more audible; then louder still the women cry,
invoking all the spirits of the other world to surrender
their grip and restore to life and vigour their beloved
tribesman. Some momentarily cease crying and call to
Bomolo to “speak words of farewell,” and the fact that
the dying man is unable to reply is a signal for louder
wailing still. At last comes the dreadful moment when
their friend ceases to breathe. For the space of a few
seconds, a breathless and awful silence prevails, whilst
brother and wife listen to the heart beat; then, with a
terrible shriek which rends the air, the wife cries, “He
is gone!”</p>

<p>Words fail to describe this scene! How can the pen
adequately portray the bursting of the pent-up misery of
these scores of relatives as, in their agony, they twist
and writhe in the dust. Wildly despairing, they grasp
in frenzy the corpse or the bed, and then releasing their
hold, they throw up their arms and again roll in the dust,
not infrequently into the log fire which smoulders on the
floor of the hut, scattering the embers amongst the
tumbling and twisting mass of wailing humanity. What
matter those burning scars?—the frenzy of a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
sorrow consumes reason and chases into oblivion the
pains of cut, bruised, scalded and burnt bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>An hour later, the storm having spent its fury, the
body is washed and prepared for the grave, but the
wailing still goes on rising and falling in a monotonous
cadence like the moan of a dying gale at sea. There is
no escape from that never-ceasing death wail until the
body is buried, which, in most villages, is generally
within forty-eight hours. Then the tide of weeping
turns. A reaction sets in and the weird dancing to drive
away the evil spirits continues throughout the night,
until mourners and relatives revive sufficiently for the
task of partitioning the wives and other worldly goods of
the deceased.</p>

<p>The death customs differ with almost every tribe.
In the watershed of the Lopori, Aruwimi and Maringa
rivers of the Congo towards the Egyptian and Uganda
borders, the corpse is frequently hung for weeks over a
fire and thoroughly smoke dried. A similar custom
prevails in certain parts of the middle and lower Congo.
The corpse, however, is dressed in the best clothes and
placed for a day or two in a life-like sitting posture—a
gruesome and unnerving sight for the passing European.
A hut in which a traveller was resting on his journey was
seen to have suspended from the roof a deep wicker basket,
from which a dark round object protruded. This, on
inquiry, he found to be the head of a child whose body,
after being smoke-dried, was hung there by the mother
that she might look upon the features of her cherished
infant. Amongst the Bakwala tribe, the custom prevails
of smoking the body of a deceased wife who may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the daughter of a distant tribe, in order that she may be
sent home and find burial amongst her own people.</p>

<p>Some of the Bakuba tribes on the Kasai, before life
is actually extinct, seize the body, bundle it unceremoniously
out of the hut, and then raising it shoulder
high rush off to a distant and unoccupied hut that the
spirit may there take flight, and not from the home which
they believe the spirit would henceforward haunt. It is
there prepared for burial, the whole village meanwhile
gathering at the house of the deceased to take part in
the general wailing.</p>

<p>Most African tribes set the civilized world an example in
their unwritten methods of preventing war, or, after war
has been declared, of bringing it to an early termination.
If it were possible to exile the Foreign Ministers of the
Great Powers of Europe to the hinterland of their respective

Cameroons, and Monsieur De Sélves to the Ubangi—where
they could divide their time between fishing and studying
the peace principles of barbarous tribes, I have little
doubt they would return to civilization with more practical
ideas upon peace than they will ever learn in the despatch
encrusted offices of London, Berlin and Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “PALAVER”</div>

<p>The African detests war and will make great sacrifices
to prevent the outbreak of hostilities. The two principal
causes of war are (1) land; (2) wives. Slave raiding
does not belong to the African; the Arab imported it.
Before war breaks out there is first the “palaver,” which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
may last many days or weeks. In palaver the debates
differ but little from the parliaments of the world, except
perhaps that custom keeps womanhood out of general
debates, although where the particular interests of women
are concerned, I have seen them throw themselves into
the debates in a manner no whit less collected and
impressive than the men.</p>

  <p class="caption">THE WITCH DOCTOR WITH HIS CHARMS FOR EVERY ILL.</p>
</div>

<p>The African revels in debate, and possibly this
accounts to some extent for the admitted passion for
litigation which now animates the civilized centres of the
African colonies. The orators of the primitive tribes
are no less masters of the art than their eloquent compeers
at Lagos and Freetown. I was once asked to visit a
first-class palaver and found a huge semi-circle of people
closely massed together. Soon after my arrival the
chief took his seat and one could almost hear the policemen
of St. Stephen’s calling out, “Speaker in the chair!”
for a similar signal was given for the palaver to
commence.</p>

<p>The chief, surrounded by his advisers, called upon the
speakers in turn; first to the right, then to the left, so
that all sides might be heard. The “palaver” had
commenced about nine o’clock, and at mid-day sun only
four speakers had been heard. The fifth, who was an
orator of some repute, rose from his stool where he had
been reclining, drank from the calabash of water handed
him by his wife, and then adjusting his loin cloth and
picking up his notes—a bundle of twigs as remembrancers
of the various points—he stepped forward. With an
air of complete mastery of his facts, he sped on quietly
for the first quarter of an hour; at the close of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
period he turned to his supporters for approving applause,
which was given in a chorus of assenting “Oh’s.” From
calm and reasoned recital of facts, he then passed on to
his deductions, and for another quarter of an hour he
drove his points home amid the now increasing interest
and applause of his own side and the derisive laughter of
the opposition.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour, excitement was beginning
to run high. The orator now threw himself into a final
effort; gathering up his facts and deductions, he charged
the other side with every species of deception and fraud,
and as he did so he danced to and fro with his body
bathed in perspiration. Every sentence now was punctuated
by the almost frenzied applause of his supporters.
In his concluding sentences he made a fervid appeal for
justice, all the while moving backward towards his
expectant friends and wives. He uttered his concluding
sentence with arms waving aloft and then swooned into
the arms of half a dozen wives who emptied their calabashes
over that quivering perspiring body. This man
had never read the trial of Warren Hastings, but I could
not help recalling Sheridan as the African orator lay there
apparently in a dead swoon—I knew of course that he
was inwardly rejoicing in his great feat and in the applause
which awoke the echo and re-echo in the great forests
immediately behind us.</p>

<p>If this “full dress” palaver fails to secure an amicable
settlement, the tribes in the Congo basin do not abandon
their efforts. They surround the villages with sentinels
and adopt various defensive measures, but before hostilities
actually begin, they select a sort of “daysman,” who, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
act in this capacity, must be of peculiar relationship
to both tribes; that is to say he must be able to claim
parentage in both dissentient communities.</p>

<p>The daysman goes forth wearing a fringed and partially
dried plantain leaf sash thrown over the shoulder
so that the sentinels of both tribes immediately recognize
him and his sacred office. It is very seldom this arbitrator
fails to secure a peaceful termination of the dispute.
If he does fail and hostilities break out causing loss of
life, he immediately renews his efforts; indeed he never
ceases that constant passing to and fro on his errand of
peace and goodwill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE CONFERENCE</div>

<p>The proposal to sheathe the sword, or, more accurately,
to unstring the bows and cleanse the poisoned arrow
heads, is followed by another palaver. It was once my
good fortune to be invited to act as arbitrator at one of
these interesting proceedings.</p>

<p>The drums in all the surrounding country were beaten
at cockcrow and immediately the two tribes, under their
respective chiefs and headmen, began marching towards
the rendezvous—a clearing in the forest outside the village
at which we were staying.</p>

<p>I was rather alarmed at the fact that though this
was a peace conference, every member of that great
concourse carried not only spears, but bows and arrows,
and I knew that the slightest indiscretion would precipitate
a bloody fight.</p>

<p>All the old history was retailed again through that
long and burning hot day. Once or twice a speaker
raised the devil in his opponents; spears were gripped
and arrows snatched from their quivers, but at last better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
counsels prevailed and terms were agreed upon. The
question at issue was a boundary dispute, but lives had
been lost and prisoners taken on both sides. The
boundary was readjusted to the apparent satisfaction
of both parties, prisoners exchanged and compensation
paid for the killed on either side—this latter surely an
advance on “civilized” terms of peace by the way!</p>

<p>The ceremony of “signing the peace” is not the
least interesting part. First a strip of leopard skin was
secured and then a bunch of palm nuts. The skin was
pinned to the ground by a dagger, and each chief and
headman followed me in driving the dagger deeper into
the earth. When it was firmly fixed the leopard skin
was drawn first one way, then the other, until it had been
completely severed. A half was given to a young chieftain
of each tribe, and they were instructed to “haste
to the river, young men, throw the separated skins upon
the waters that all men may know the quarrel is now
cut in pieces (<i>i.e.</i>, is destroyed).” This done, the bunch
of palm nuts was taken and a spear from each party
driven into the head of nuts. Two more men were
selected, again from each tribe, and instructed to “Carry
that head of nuts carefully, young men, throw them into
the river that all men may know that our spear heads
are buried, that fighting is over and peace made for ever
and for ever.”</p>

<p>In this exceptional case the “for ever and for ever”
only lasted three months! but in the great majority of
such cases peace though threatened is maintained for
many a year.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE NATIVE AS A MONEY MAKER</span></h3>

</div>

<p>If the African woman is a prudent banker, the man is the
money maker. The range of remuneration they receive for
their labour is no less divergent than one finds in Europe.
The Sierra Leone native will obligingly row you ashore
to Freetown in fifteen minutes “for two bob, Sah”; but
his brother paddler on the Chiloango, or the Congo, will
paddle for you throughout a week for 5<i>d.</i> a day, coupled
with a plump bat or the leg of a monkey by way of rations.</p>

<p>There is one form of money making which is fastening
its fell grip ever more firmly upon the middle-class African—money
lending. It is extremely difficult to deal with
this question in West Africa by legislation, but a good deal
can be accomplished in various directions by a watchful
administration. One case brought to my notice was that
of a cook who was compelled to pay £2 10<i>s.</i> interest on a
loan of £4 for six months. Another one was that of a
teacher who required a loan of £6, for which he had to
pay 12<i>s.</i> per month interest. I was also assured that
frequently 10<i>s.</i> a month interest is exacted for small loans
of £1. In some parts of the Gold Coast borrowers find
themselves in such straits that they are often compelled to
pawn their children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAGES AND WIVES</div>

<p>The wages of agricultural labourers vary very considerably.
In Southern Nigeria labourers working for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
native employers receive from 15<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> per month.
The contracted labourers on the islands of the Gulf of
Guinea—that is Fernando Po, San Thomé and Principe—are
all “contracted” at paper wages, varying from 10s.
to 15<i>s.</i> per month, but neither under the Spanish or
Portuguese Administrations do they receive more than
half their pay when it is due, the other half being placed
in the hands of the Curador. In German Cameroons
the wage is seldom more than 10<i>s.</i> a month, and more
often the labourers only receive 8<i>s.</i> In the hinterland
of Belgian and French Congo, the unskilled labourer
receives from 6<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> per month. All these wages are
exclusive of board and lodging, but generally a certain
amount of clothing is supplied freely. In many parts
of the various colonies, however, stores are opened by the
plantation owners to tempt the labourer into purchasing
goods which usually carry a respectable profit.</p>

<p>The hardest work and the poorest pay falls to the
carrier; that patient burden bearer rarely gets, in any
part of Africa, more than about 9<i>d.</i> per day for his heavy
task. The Upper Congo was thrown open to the advance
forces of civilization by a continuous stream of carriers,
who occupied from a fortnight to three weeks reaching
Stanley Pool from Matadi, a journey for which they
seldom received more than a sovereign a load. “Big
money,” however, is earned by the cocoa carriers of the
Gold Coast, but the conditions are entirely abnormal.
The cocoa carrying enterprise as at present organized
cannot be other than a temporary expedient and the
general army of African carriers will have to be content
with a wage varying from 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>The African is by nature a trader, and no more
honest than many Europeans in his business transactions,
and on the whole I am afraid less honest than the reputable
business houses of West Africa. It is only fair to
say that the native merchants trained under the rigid
standard of European firms—particularly the Basel
Mission of the Gold Coast—maintain a standard of
honest trading which does credit to the firms under which
they received their commercial education.</p>

<p>The ambition of most young men on the Upper Congo
is focussed upon wives. Without earthly possessions,
their only hope of matrimonial bliss is in the death of a
relative from whom they may “inherit” a partner, if
there is a disparity in age an “exchange” is always
possible, subject, of, course, to an additional dowry.
But this chance is remote and the waiting time is always
long, tedious, and full of social complications. One day
a young man in the Congo endowed with more than the
usual share of courage and trading instinct, hit upon a
plan which has for years found increasing favour. The
captains of steamers could only with difficulty work their
boats up and down that 2000 miles of waterway between
Stanley Pool and the great tributaries of the Upper
Congo, for lack of wood fuel from the forests. Here, then,
was the chance for the enterprising native. He bargained
with the white man upon the following basis. To travel
with him to Stanley Pool and back again, a journey
occupying four weeks, to cut a square yard of wood every
night on the journey, and to be allowed to sleep during
the day. The wages for this enterprise to be ten francs
payable at Stanley Pool, and the free transport back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
again of one bag of salt and one box of sundries. This
suggestion, sound in its common-sense, giving the white
man fuel without trouble, was promptly agreed upon,
and with ten others on the same terms the contract was
confirmed. The white man went to his bunk that night,
happy in the thought that for one journey at least he
would be saved the eternal “wooding palaver.” The
native youths, too, went to sleep, and possibly dreamed
of the wedded bliss which was now so unexpectedly
within sight.</p>

<p>Four weeks later the “Stern Wheeler” returned and
put the respective wood cutters ashore at their different
villages, each with a bag of salt and a few sundries purchased
at Stanley Pool with the 10 francs. The eyes of
certain comely young African women shone brightly that
night as they heard of the brilliant enterprise of their
prospective mates. A few days later two or three
parties in small canoes pushed away from the banks and
started on a ten days’ journey up one of the small
tributaries which abound everywhere on the Upper Congo.
In each canoe were precious bags of salt and a tiny spoon
for retailing the “white powder” to distant tribes. A
fortnight later family palavers were held and a sufficient
dowry laid at the feet of the damsel’s father. The
nightly wood-chopping enterprise had produced 10
francs which had in turn obtained a bag of salt, a hundred
common safety pins and a cheap mirror. The salt and
pins had disappeared and there lay on the ground in their
place the coveted dowry of £2 sterling in native money
for the father, and a mirror for the mother of the
native bride who now gladly joined her husband for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
better or for worse. There is your African trading
instinct!</p>

<p>Since that day many a young man has followed that
example, but with competition dowries have risen and the
value of European produce fallen. Nevertheless, to-day,
many a native on the Congo waterways is cutting firewood
to and from the ports in the hope of raising the wherewithal
to obtain his heart’s desire.</p>

<p>It is said of the Indian coolie that anywhere he will
make two blades grow to the one blade the white man can
produce. In this respect the African follows hard on the
heels of his Indian rival. The white man will often
select what seems a most promising piece of land, but for
some reason his crops fail. The native will choose a
little out-of-the-way patch and cultivate it in a style
which calls forth a pitying, almost contemptuous smile
from the white, but somehow that native has struck
fertility and his crops flourish amazingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGRICULTURAL WAGES</div>

<p>In Southern Nigeria I met several successful native
farmers, who seem in some respects to outdo their friends
in the neighbouring colony of the Gold Coast. One of
these had some years ago bought 200 acres of land at 4<i>s.</i>
per acre, and soon it was discovered that he had obtained
a very fertile patch and he was offered no less than £5
an acre and his crops at valuation, but Mr. X. has a keen
business head upon his shoulders and finds it more profitable
to cultivate cocoa, palm nuts and rubber than to
sell his land even at an enhanced price. Every time he
makes a few pounds he extends his plantation, “pulls
down his barns and builds greater.” This man has now
a turnover of nearly £20,000 a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KEEN TRADER</div>

<p>There are scattered all down the coast in British
colonies native traders pressing on to positions of dominating
influence. These men can handle cargoes of four figures
and pay at an hour’s notice. They receive regular cable
information of the prices of different commodities on the
European market, and several of them have branches
which connect by telephone. Most of them conduct
their business on modern principles with typists, cashiers,
messenger boys and so forth. Not a few of them are
frequently in a financial position to strike a bargain and
settle a transaction before the European firm can get a
cable reply from the home directors. They are up-to-date
traders in being able to supply anything which may
be demanded of them, or if not in stock they will promise
it—and keep the promise—on a given day. If an order
is specially urgent and has to come from Europe, a
messenger will meet the ship, take off the package and
deliver it to the client within an hour or two of the ship’s
arrival. One of the most interesting transactions I
know of occurred in a certain British colony. A chief,
for some reason, was in great need of a large elephant’s
tusk, and after fruitless endeavours to obtain one, a native
trader relieved the old man’s anxiety by offering to deliver
a tusk the required size, to cost about £80, within a
month. Promptly to time the tusk was delivered—the
cute trader had cabled to Europe for it! “Holts,”
“Millers,” and other all-wise competitors in that town
knew how imperative it was that this old chief should
have a big tusk, and I was told they tried their “up
country” stores, but it never occurred to them to
order from Europe. There again is the African trading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
instinct, which put a clear £10 note in the trader’s
pocket!</p>

<p>The legal profession is beyond question the most
lucrative in West Africa, but this does not obtain in
Africa alone. The mass of the people have not yet
learned to settle their troubles without the aid of the
legal community. The fees paid to the coast barristers
are surprising. I was informed that in one colony more
than one native barrister has an income of close on five
figures. I had no reliable evidence upon this and should
think it an exaggeration, but the style in which the
coast barrister lives and moves must certainly require a
substantial income. Certain it is too that none are more
generous with their money.</p>

<p>Unlike the medical profession, no colour-bar stands
between the barrister and the free exercise of his ability.
Surely the position of these medical men calls loudly for
redress, the profession which, above all others, is needed
in the fever-haunted colonies of Africa, yet between the
increase of these men and the countless sufferers there
is firmly fixed the detestable colour-bar of prejudice.</p>

<p>Though the native has not yet become convinced of
the safety of banking, the sums placed by them on deposit
in the three British colonies—Sierra Leone, the Gold
Coast and Nigeria, are nearly £80,000.</p>

<p>When we reflect upon these natives rising to positions
of greater power and influence in British colonies, and
when we are prone to criticize British administrations, it
will not hurt any of us, either native or European, to
remember that less than a century ago these centres were
amongst the principal slave markets of the world.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE AFRICAN WOMAN</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There is assuredly no country whose women are more
interesting than those of Central Africa. Certainly
there can be no place on the habitable globe where women
are so continuously industrious. Amongst African
women there are no unemployed and no unemployables.
In all the hinterland, the women are the agriculturists.
In the early morning, often before sunrise, they file
out of the village to their plots, perhaps a mile away
from the town, where there is always something to do;
weeding and planting being almost an integral part of
the daily routine. When the gardens have received
attention, meals must be considered and the woman
proceeds to dig up the manioca tubers, but only to bury
them beneath the water in some forest stream or pool to
extract the injurious element. In a few days hence the
load of sodden tubers will be ready for the native culinary
art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAILY BREAD</div>

<p>Ten minutes in the forest and the woman has gathered
the fuel required for her cooking; then loading her basket
with the manioca left to soak six days before, she places
a layer of leaves between it and the firewood, and shoulders
her burden. She steps out brightly for home, in company
with perhaps another twenty matrons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>It is not every day that she is able to finish by
noon, for in the planting season the gardens demand her
labour for whole days at a stretch. Some weeks before
the husband has perhaps started a new field by cutting
down at immense labour hundreds of trees, which lie
there scattered in all directions till the tropical sun
dries up the leaves and smaller branches. Then a torch
at one end of the clearing starts the whole area in a
blaze.</p>

<p>It is at this stage that the wife comes along with her
seeds and cuttings, digging little mounds all over the
area and raising the soil by heaping upon it the cinders,
dead leaves and ash, which provide the only manure
these primitive folk possess. Between the rows of
manioca she may plant gourds, Indian corn and ground
nuts, and thus secure a general crop all over her cultivated
field.</p>

<p>From Sierra Leone right away to the north bank of
the Kasai, these domestic crops vary but little, but on
arriving at the southern bank of the Kasai, the change
becomes very marked, for the extensive fields of manioca
and cassava give way to mealies as the staple food.</p>

<p>The field is the first charge, so to speak, upon the
time of the African woman, but to her belongs also the
major responsibility for providing the daily meals. The
primitive African is almost a vegetarian, though he
dearly loves meat. Trapping edible fish is by no means
frequent, and the wife, knowing with her civilized sister
how important it is to feed the man, will often snatch an
hour or two from her busy life and run to the nearest
stream and catch some “small fry,” with which to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
make savoury the evening meal of cassava and pottage.
In season she will hunt through the forests for the caterpillars
which abound on certain trees and which by
some tribes are regarded as great delicacies, particularly
those tribes inhabiting French and Belgian Congo and
the Cameroons. The Gold Coast people substitute large
snails, of which they appear inordinately fond.</p>

<p>There are four principal dishes which, with slight
variations, prevail throughout Western Africa:—</p>

<p>1. There is the staple food of manioca, which is
sometimes boiled and pounded into puddings, resembling
a lump of glazier’s putty. Cassava or sweet manioca is
never soaked, but cooked fresh from the ground and is
much liked by Europeans.</p>

<p>2. The plantain, which is prepared in many forms by
roasting, baking, frying and boiling.</p>

<p>3. There is pottage, the body of which is composed of
pounded leaves from the manioca plant, closely resembling
spinach. In most parts of the tropics, green
Indian corn is introduced freely into this dish.</p>

<p>4. There is the palm oil chop, which, as I have shewn
in another part of this book, is not a “chop” at all, but
anything from a caterpillar or a beetle to the leg of a
dog or buffalo.</p>

<p>Perhaps next in importance to the position of agriculturist
is that of cook. Give the African woman a
clay pot, a pestle and mortar and a few leaves, and she
will produce in quick time a meal which even a European
can relish. She is a trifle too fond of chili peppers and
palm oil for a sensitive palate and fully believes that a
fair proportion of earth and other etceteras add to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
flavour and digestibility. Her husband, with a natural
weakness for chili peppers and oil, and himself not averse
to “foreign bodies” in his food, readily consumes nearly
two pounds of prepared manioca and pottage at a single
meal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WOMAN IN THE HOME</div>

<p>With cockcrow, the woman rises, steps outside the
hut and in lieu of washing herself, yawns two or three
times, then stretches herself in several directions, and is
ready for the day’s work. She will first sweep her hut,
open the chicken-house, pluck a few dew-covered leaves
to wipe over the faces of the children, and then pick up
her basket and set out for the gardens. Returning, she
will pull the fire logs together and again shoulder her
basket and go off to catch fish, or to hunt caterpillars.
Some of the older wives may stay in the village to fashion
clay cooking pots, weave baskets and mats, or crack
palm kernels.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus24" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus24.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">WOMEN POUNDING OIL PALM NUTS.</p>
</div>

<p>About four o’clock, “when the monkeys in the forest
begin to chatter,” the women return to their huts and
commence preparing for the principal meal of the day.
Above the hum of conversation, the passing jest, or the
humorous repartee, the clear ringing thud, thud, of pestle
and mortar is distinctly heard. Most dishes at some
stage or the other are pounded. The boiled manioca,
the pottage leaves, the palm nuts, the plantains, all find
their way to the mortar, and no doubt the muscular
physique of many of the women is largely the result of
the perpetual wielding of the heavy wooden pestle.</p>

<p>The African woman is at home with any industry,
hardly anything comes strange to those deft fingers and
muscular arms. The husband may go on a journey by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
canoe, and his wife, or wives, will be there paddling
amidships and cooking the meals at intervals. The
husband, however, always takes the post of danger,
which may be bow or stern, according to the weather,
the current, or the district through which they may be
passing.</p>

<p>Much has been written, backed by little knowledge,
about the brutality of man in making the woman carry
the loads when on an overland journey. To the uninitiated
European, it may seem callous for a strong able-bodied
man to walk in front of a line of women every one
of whom is struggling along with a 50-pound load on her
back. But make them change positions, force the man
to take the load, tell the women to walk in front, and
before you have gone many yards the women will all
have bolted into the bush, for the “Lord Protector”
under a load is no longer ready to shield them from the
danger which lurks behind every tree and beneath almost
every leaf in the African forests. The African knows his
business when on a journey, and his first duty, from
which no matter what the odds, he never shrinks, is that
of protecting his family from the ravages of wild animals
no less than the violence of hostile tribes. But to do
this he must be unencumbered and alert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOMAN A MONEYMAKER</div>

<p>The women of West Africa, by reason of their thrifty
natures, are frequently the bankers. To them the
husband entrusts the keeping of his worldly goods, and
right sacredly they guard anything placed in their keeping.
Not only are the women trustworthy bankers, but as
moneymakers they are extremely keen. The finest
business woman it has been my lot to meet was a farmer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
woman of Abeokuta. This old lady could tell at sight,
almost to a penny, the value of a pile of kernels without
weighing them. I fell to discussing with her so technical
a question as the possibility of cotton in Southern Nigeria,
and she was adamant in her opinion upon this: “Unless
they can guarantee me 1<i>d.</i> per pound for unginned cotton
and 4½<i>d.</i> per pound for the ginned, I would even prefer to
grow yams.” I gathered that on the whole she was not
likely to become a shareholder in any cotton producing
company.</p>

<p>In the mart the women excel. It may be in the
streets of Accra, Abeokuta, Freetown, or in that finest
of all marts in West Africa—Loanda, or again in some
wayside market of a tributary river in the far distant
hinterland. Wherever you find the market, the women
are in control and right merrily goes the auction. The
din amounts to a pandemonium, the tricks of the trade
are to be looked for in every basket of fruit or pile of
vegetables. The eggs are probably old ones, carefully
washed and possibly doctored; that fowl tied by the
legs could not walk from sickness if it were free. Billingsgate,
Smithfield, Covent Garden, rolled into one could
not be at once more entertaining, more noisy and more
novel than those African markets where you may buy
almost everything you want, and receive a great deal
gratis that is not welcome.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The African Wife</span></h4>

<p>Is there any feature, social, political or religious so
important in West Africa as the wife and mother? No
“teeming millions” are to be found in the African<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
tropics and every colony is crying out for more native
workers as the development of her industries gets beyond
the fringe. As a wife the African woman is generally
but one of a number. In most coast towns to-day the
stress of modern competition has forced up the cost of
living, which together with the absorption of civilized
ideas has made monogamy—oftentimes, alas, only surface
monogamy—the passport into respectable society. But
away from the coast towns, though it be only a few miles
away, polygamy is prevalent almost throughout West
Africa.</p>

<p>Christian converts profess an abhorrence, and in
many cases I am satisfied a sincere abhorrence, of polygamy,
but the fact remains that this causes more trouble
in the Christian Churches in West Africa than all other
evils put together. In the purely pagan areas there is
no doubt that the woman regards polygamy as a desirable
condition; she argues that the position of the husband
is gauged by his many possessions—wives and cattle, and
that she prefers being the wife of a great man to that of
some insignificant fellow who can afford to keep but
one! Again she will point out, and with obvious truth,
that if a man possesses several wives, the burden of
agriculture, of fishing, of kernel-cracking, and the domestic
duties spread over four, five or more persons is proportionately
lighter upon each individual.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus27.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">WEAVING CLOTH IN THE KASAI, UPPER CONGO.</p>
</div>

<p>Into the sentiment of polygamy there is also the
practical consideration of offspring. No matter how
plain the daughters, no matter how slightly cicatrized
they may be, no matter what imperfections the boys
may have, if they are the children of a much married man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
they are certain to make “good matches.” The sons
may be certain of securing the daughters of chiefs no less
famous than their father; if a girl, her dowry will not
be her intrinsic worth, but will be gauged likewise by
the position and possessions of her father.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INHERITED WIVES</div>

<p>It does not seem to be generally recognized that there
is both voluntary polygamy and in a very real sense
obligatory polygamy. A man inherits wives from his
father or uncle, just as he inherits other possessions. In
most cases of course he gladly accepts his inheritance.
This, I know, is a revolting custom to the European,
but to the African not merely desirable but the
only honourable future for his father’s wives. His own
mother reigns as a sort of dowager Queen in the household
and keeps order in the harem of her son. I have
often discussed this feature with the women themselves
and find that invariably they regard any other course
with the utmost repugnance. Why, they say, should
they suffer the disgrace of being passed on to other
husbands; what evil have they done that their rightful
husband should disown them and refuse to accept them
as his wives? his father loved and cherished them, and
why should the son disgrace his father’s name by refusing
to follow in his steps!</p>

<p>In one or two cases Christian men have actually
put away wives whom they have inherited in this manner,
but the women concerned have always felt that the
shadow of disgrace has fallen upon them and that they
are outcasts from the social life of the tribe.</p>

<p>This custom, like most extreme polygamous concomitants,
finds its fullest development in the upper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
reaches of the Congo river, but it is also found practically
throughout the whole of the Congo basin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIANITY AND POLYGAMY</div>

<p>The general attitude adopted by missionaries in West
Africa is that of rigidly excluding the husband of more
than one wife from Church membership, and this no
doubt accounts for the apparent lack of success which
statistics seem at first sight to demonstrate. Almost
every missionary, however, will point out to the traveller,
man after man who, though not a member of his church
is, he declares, with a regretful sigh, “more of a Christian
than the majority of our members.” The German Basel
Mission in the Cameroons excludes all polygamists from
Church membership and they have been fortunate in
obtaining King Bell as a monogamist member. In the
“oil rivers” of the Niger, the same rigorous position is
taken up by the missionaries.</p>

<p>In not a few churches in Southern Nigeria, polygamists
are certainly admitted to membership of the
churches. These men if not openly polygamous are
notoriously so in private life.</p>

<p>The Christian Church has, in polygamy, a problem
which at present defies solution; the custom is so much
an integral part of African life that a conversion to
Christianity involves an abrupt termination of the
convert’s former habits, the effects of which reach far
beyond the individual most intimately concerned. One
of the greatest difficulties is that of the outcast wives.
In one Mission in Southern Nigeria if a man becomes a
Christian convert he is asked to call his wives together
and explain his position, then to select one, put the
others away and provide for their maintenance. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
even this involves a sense of injustice and is, I am told,
fruitful in many cases of deplorable results. The women
thus set aside regard themselves not unnaturally as
outcasts, as they have lost the affection of their husbands
and are therefore in disgrace. In many cases, I am told,
these women become either temporarily or permanently
the mistresses of other men who do not hesitate to taunt
them with the fact that they are outcasts from ordinary
native society.</p>

<p>No doubt there are exceptional cases where women
so put away find mates amongst the bachelor members
of the Christian community, but even these young
fellows—and more particularly their parents—are not
always over anxious to accept as a wife for their son
the woman whom another man has set aside.</p>

<p>The Honourable Sapara Williams, one of the ablest
men in West Africa, expressed the opinion that it is
imperative the Christian Church should find some other
solution than exists to-day for this difficulty if it is to
maintain and increase its hold upon the native tribes
of tropical Africa. We see already a native Christian
Community in Southern Nigeria known as the African
Church existing avowedly upon a polygamous basis and
growing rapidly in membership and influence. This
Church is entirely self-supporting and is becoming more
and more propagandist. In the course of time it may
easily produce what will be called an “African Wesley,”
or an “African Spurgeon,” and the result we can foresee.
The African <i>en masse</i> is inflammable material and intensely
patriotic; let such a man emerge from their ranks
and the doctrines he preaches will spread like wildfire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>It is universally recognized that in case of any modification
of the attitude now adopted by the European
government of Christian Churches, thousands of adherents
would be secured in every colony. The heroic
attitude hitherto adopted surrenders to Mohammedanism
a potent factor in the propagation of its beliefs, hence the
extraordinary advance made by the apostles of the prophet.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the position maintained by
the Christian Churches as a whole upon this aspect of
its work leads to widespread immorality amongst Church
members, but wherever it becomes too notorious, the
delinquents are, with certain exceptions, excluded from
membership. It will be readily seen therefore that
should any single Christian denomination once lower
its standard in this respect, converts would flock to it in
thousands. The African Church does this, and springing
from the people themselves, meets the situation. Its
members probably represent the Christian natives of the
near future in Southern Nigeria, men for the most part
commercially successful, boldly solving their own problems,
living an easy-going and comfortable life, their
religious standard lowered to their own desires. Can we
criticize them? If we do, we must beware, for they will
tell us that it is more honest to live open polygamous
lives than the fraudulent lives of professing Christians—white
and black—whose hypocritical attitude, particularly
on sex questions, is a by-word on the West Coast of
Africa. I fear there is too much truth in this retort.
White men, at least, must hold their peace, and there
lies the greatest danger!</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLYGAMY AND THE BIRTH RATE</div>

<p>It is generally accepted that polygamy is productive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
of a high birth rate, and Sir William Muir has given this
as one reason for the almost miraculous advance of
Mohammedanism. It may have been, and may still be
true to-day of Mohammedanism that polygamy produces
a high birth rate, but that existing polygamists in tropical
Africa to-day produce a greater number of births than
monogamists is, I am satisfied, open to serious question.
At the same time I think it is clear that prior to European
occupation, polygamist Africa maintained a higher birth
rate than is possible under modern conditions.</p>

<p>The reason for this is not far to seek, for the chiefs,
possessing as they did unrestricted power over the
community, could terrorize into complete submission
every unit of the tribe. Wherever polygamy existed
the wife was kept faithful to the one husband by the
knowledge that unchastity was forthwith rewarded by
instant death. The young men also knew that a <i>liaison</i>
meant either that they were sold into slavery, involving
in all probability ultimate sacrifice, or they would be
hanged on the nearest tree.</p>

<p>This is so even to-day amongst those tribes beyond
the reach of white men. One day, when crossing towards
the main Congo river, I suddenly heard wild shrieks
from a person evidently in great danger. Rushing to
the spot, I found a woman bound hand and foot, and
standing over her was a burly young chief with an
executioner’s knife raised aloft. In a moment more
that woman’s head would have been hacked off had I
not promptly gripped the man’s arm. With a terrible
oath he attempted to spring upon me, but the headmen
of the village, who had also hurried to the scene, fell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
upon him and wrenched the knife from his hand. For a
quarter of an hour nothing would stay the man’s fury;
it took six of us to hold him. Ultimately, however, he
calmed down and explained to me that his wife had been
unfaithful and that she merited the death penalty. I
gave him some presents to appease him further and he
agreed to forgive the woman if I would “reward him.”
As the gift he asked was to me a trivial matter, and the
only chance of saving the woman’s life, I gave it to him.
The woman herself, in gratitude, at once wrenched
from off her wrists a bracelet which she presented to me
as a keepsake. I fear, however, that after I left the
village, she suffered a cruel death for her unfaithfulness.
It will be readily seen that these conditions are only
possible in regions where there is no restraining hand.</p>

<p>The question of the birth rate under monogamist
and polygamist marriages in West Africa has always
been of absorbing interest to me and my diaries are full
of jottings bearing upon the subject, but very few are
worth a permanent record. Amongst the Christians of
Accra many monogamists have considerable families
and from personal observation twins appeared to be
fairly frequent. In the hinterland, we were informed,
that the “baku”—or tenth child—is by no means rare
amongst the “Twi” people. The largest family we
found amongst the monogamists of the Bangalla region
of the Congo was five children, the average appearing
to be three. But West Africa is very weak in reliable
statistics.</p>

<p>In our recent journeys, I selected four areas and
obtained with some accuracy the composition of several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
groups of villages. It was impossible to accept the
figures from some districts because the people, fearing
there was some subtle move behind our requests, either
gave evasive replies or figures which were obviously
inaccurate.</p>

<p>The following six groups, however, are reliable.
They were gathered from areas hundreds, and in one
case over a thousand miles apart:—</p>

<p>The birth rate figures are lamentably low, and being
selected from areas so widely apart give anything but
an encouraging indication for the future of the Congo.
The deductions from these figures is unmistakable and
only confirms what one hears everywhere, not only in
the Congo but all over the West Coast of the utter
demoralization which is flooding these territories.</p>

<p>The Congo is by far the worst. Europe was staggered
at the Leopoldian atrocities and they were terrible
indeed, but what we, who were behind the scenes, felt
most keenly was the fact that the real catastrophe in
the Congo was desolation and murder in the larger sense.
The invasion of family life, the ruthless destruction of
every social barrier, the shattering of every tribal law,
the introduction of criminal practices which struck the
chiefs of the people dumb with horror—in a word, a
veritable avalanche of filth and immorality overwhelmed
the Congo tribes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ONLY HOPE</div>

<p>To-day one sees the havoc which King Leopold
created when he let loose upon the Congo tribes the
scum of Europe. None have escaped the infection;
girls of tender years and even boys not yet in their
teens delight in practices of which in the old days the
chiefs would have kept them in complete ignorance for
another five years. Upon the women the results have
been by far the most revolting, for in the Congo the
majority of women have lost their womanhood and have
fallen into a daily condition from which even the beasts
of the forest refrain.</p>

<p>The truth is that in the greater part of West Africa
neither monogamy nor polygamy is the prevailing relationship
between man and woman. Doctors, administrators
and missionaries all know it, and are all
powerless at present to bring the situation under control.
It is useless for the administration to make laws for
practices beneath the surface, the only thing the officials
can do, and should do without delay, is to see to it that
an ever higher example is set to the natives. This is
where the Belgian and French Congo officials have failed
so utterly.</p>

<p>The Christian missionary alone touches the evil, and
though he is defeated again and again, he plods steadily
on preaching a perfect chastity—too lofty a standard
for most natives at present—but without doubt gathering
round him an ever increasing number not only of men
but of women who, apart from occasional lapses, set a
bright example to the whole countryside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOTHERHOOD</div>

<p>The birth of children is in primitive Africa rarely
attended by anything abnormal. If a native nurse is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
confronted with complications, she immediately throws
up the case in despair and appeals to the witch doctor,
but normally the birth of children is taken as quite an
ordinary part of the daily life. One day we were passing
through a native village, and there, lying on a plantain
leaf, were two chubby little twin girls but half-an-hour
old; the mother was sitting close by “resting.” This
picture was so beautifully simple that my wife went
with a boy to bring up the camera and plates, but on
arriving at the spot in about twenty minutes the woman
had picked up her twins and carried them home! That
is primitive Africa, but in the coast towns where African
womanhood delights in corsets and other European
follies, the suffering at childbirth is in many cases almost
as acute as that amongst the European community.
With several Congo tribes, the belief is firmly rooted
and put into practice that in order to change the colostrum
flow to that of milk, co-habitation is essential.</p>

<p>With many tribes throughout West Africa, the period
of lactation is prolonged; frequently the mother nurses
the child until it is two, three, and even four, years old.
A case of adultery was brought before the District Commissioner’s
Court at Ikorodu in Southern Nigeria in April
last year, and in the evidence it came out that the accused
woman was suckling a child four years of age. The District
Commissioner ordered her to cease nursing the child
within three months.</p>

<p>The death rate amongst the young children in West
Africa is very high and no doubt arises from the deplorable
manner in which they are brought up. There
is practically no attention given to diet or cleanliness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
with the result that any disease which attacks a family
quickly spreads through the community.</p>

<p>Amongst the Dagomba of the Northern territories of
the Gold Coast colony, the woman who has given birth
to a child leaves her husband’s compound and goes to
that of the father-in-law, taking the child with her,
where they stay for a year. At the end of this period
the wife and child return to the home of the husband
and father.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Twins</span></h4>

<div class="sidenote">TWINS</div>

<p>It is a mistake to assume, as some writers do, that
the taboo on twins is a prevailing custom amongst
West African tribes. The distribution of the taboo is
extremely erratic. Twins are unwelcome in the Northern
territories of the Gold Coast, yet the reverse is the case
amongst the Egbas of Nigeria. In the Congo territories,
twins cause the greatest joy to a tribe and the mother is
lauded wherever she goes, whilst amongst the tribes of
the oil rivers of Nigeria, the birth of twins is regarded
as the most fearful calamity which can fall upon the
community.</p>

<p>In the Upper Congo regions, the traveller may frequently
see two earthenware pots hoisted on forked
stakes which have been driven in the ground, one on
either side of the path, and these are in honour of twins
born in the nearest compound. Every person passing
by those pots will religiously pluck two leaves and throw
one at the foot of each forked pole as a votive offering
to “Bokecu” and “Mboyo,” as all good twins are
named.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>The tragedy of the oil rivers is one of the most distressing
in West Africa. Throughout the Eastern, and
to a considerable extent of the Central Province, the
cruel custom prevails of putting to death one, sometimes
both twins. The British Government spares no pains
in the effort to combat and overcome these practices,
but though much good has resulted, the custom still
holds its own.</p>

<p>Not only are the children killed, but the mother is
immediately driven from home for she is no longer regarded
as a chaste woman and rapidly becomes an
outcast from Society, living upon the proceeds of prostitution.
In some districts, however, this custom is
less rigorous, and the mothers of twins are allowed to
form isolated villages and to engage in trade. Some
tribes, again, whilst driving them from the homes of
their husbands, permit them to engage in agricultural
pursuits upon the husband’s lands.</p>

<p>The missionaries are doing much towards weaning
the tribes from this murderous practice. One missionary
society working amongst the Ibunos, a tribe of five
thousand people, claims that through the conversion to
Christianity of a large section of this tribe, the horrible
practice of murdering the twins and making the women
outcasts has ceased. It is of course difficult to control
absolutely a statement of that kind, but it is only the
Christian missionary who can hope to deal effectively
and permanently with a subterranean evil like twin
murder.</p>

<p>An interesting custom which survives in the Upper
Congo is that a man may never see or speak to his mother-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and should he by accident turn a corner in the
village compound and meet her face to face, he must at

into the house where he is sitting, he will promptly raise
a mat and hold it between them, so that they may not
see each other.</p>

<p>On the whole the lot of the African woman is a hard
one. She has her occasional pleasures it is true, but
from childhood hers is a lifelong drudgery with, however,
the one sure recompense, that in old age it is
the joy and the privilege of the younger generation to
support her.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WHITE MAN’S BURDEN</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There is a type of African traveller who, hurrying to
the coast and back again, returns with all the assurance
of a long experienced person to pontifically declare that
the unhealthiness of West Africa is all moonshine, that
if a man dies it is due to his excesses rather than to the
climate. There is, of course, a grain of truth in this
assertion; cocktails, midnight oil and habits of a worse
type, undermine the constitution in a manner which
leave little resistance to the climatic diseases. Yet
after all, tropical Africa is a death-trap.</p>

<p>Some of these assertive and incredulous persons
have themselves been badly punished for their advertised
temerity. The story goes of one lady who, after having
published much nonsense on this subject, was bundled
off home in an ice pack! I know one man who, after a
year or two of good health, gave rein to his opinion in
the columns of the <i>Times</i>; this good man was no believer
in short and effective service, followed by a well-earned
period of leave; he advocated long terms of residence
as the certain road to immunity; that man spent a single
term in Africa, towards the close of which the climate
made such inroads upon his constitution, that he was
never allowed to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>Those who feel inclined to trifle with and ridicule
the dangers attendant upon life in Africa should spend
a solid year in some lonely post directing a staff not
always amenable to discipline; should live in that
comfortless bungalow; should endeavour to tempt the
appetite day after day with something from a tin which,
no matter what it is called, invariably has the same
taste. Then probably a fever intervenes and the lonely
resident goes to bed with limbs racked with pain and a
head throbbing like the puffing of an express train. By
this time the supercilious writer would be brought to
know that after all, the climate of West Africa is not that
of the Swiss lakes or the Austrian Tyrol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STORY THE GRAVEYARDS TELL</div>

<p>It may be a melancholy undertaking, but all whites
going to West Africa should brace themselves to the
duty of visiting the cemeteries. What a story the
graveyards of West Africa tell! The fair young lives
laid down for the comfort of posterity. Men of all
walks in life are there—the official and the trader, pitiably
aloof in daily life, now lying side by side; they are
there from every profession and trade, the engineer and
the miner, the planter and the doctor, the young wife
and perhaps the new-born infant. Africa—always cruel—has
taken them in the very flower of their manhood
and womanhood.</p>

<p>On the Gold Coast I one day walked into the cemetery
and standing in one spot recorded the ages inscribed on
twenty-seven of the surrounding tombstones; the oldest
amongst the deceased was only forty-six years, and
amongst the youngest, two had succumbed at the early
age of twenty-two. The average was exactly thirty-two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
years. Not a few had inscribed upon the tombs such
information as, “After two days’ illness.” “After
only three weeks in the colony.” “After three days’
illness.” “Died on the way to the coast,” and so
forth.</p>

<p>One interesting feature about this cemetery is that
it is enclosed with a stone wall, about four feet high,
and all white men may be buried within the compound,
as also respectable natives—respectability, so my native
guide informed me, being determined by church-going.
Natives, therefore, who were not attendants at church,
were buried “outside the wall.” Looking over I could
see some scores of graves of natives who, not having
attended church in life, were divided in death from the
church-goers by a foot of stone wall.</p>

<p>Merchants and missionaries would do well to watch
more closely the mortality returns of Government
publications, for there alone may be seen recorded the
effect of furloughs on the health of Europeans. In the
slow moving times of twenty years ago, men went to the
coast for long periods, and many a missionary and
merchant stayed until he died. Government officials,
too, were kept at their posts until death carried them
off, or they were invalided beyond the possibility of a
return. It is instructive to note that mortality is much
lower among Government officials, arising beyond question
from the fact that they serve short periods, generally
of one year only, and then take a furlough in Europe.
For many reasons the figures for the years 1901 and 1910
may be regarded as average records. The death-rates
among the whites in the two colonies of the Gold Coast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
and Southern Nigeria, showing a remarkable improvement,
are as follows:—</p>

<p>Most merchants argue that they cannot afford to
bring their men to Europe for short furloughs every
year, but one or two good houses are making the experiment
with not a little satisfaction to themselves in more
than one direction. In the first place a better type of
man offers for a short agreement, and then there is the
consideration that by preserving the lives of those they
have trained, merchants thus avoid the constant re-equipment
of new men, the cost of which is very considerable.
Nor is the financial aspect the only feature
which is proving satisfactory. These merchants find
that they reap great commercial advantages over their
competitors by being able to hold more frequent consultations
with their men. After all, the incidence
of cost in connection with passages to and fro is
comparatively insignificant on the whole expenditure
of the far-reaching commercial enterprises of West
Africa.</p>

<p>To preserve the white man’s life in Africa, other
elements are equally essential. The dwelling-house,
recreation and provisions are features sadly neglected
by the majority of whites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN AFRICAN HOME</div>

<p>There is so much monotony, so much to irritate and
to depress in West Africa, that everything Governments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
and merchants can do to brighten the lives of their
employés should be done. The prettiest and happiest
of homes are without doubt in German and Portuguese
colonies. In both cases it is due, to a very large extent, to
the fact that these nations give every encouragement to
the taking out of white women, whose very presence,
flitting to and fro in the essentially light garments of
the tropics, give more than a touch of poetry to surroundings
already anything but prosaic.</p>

<p>The Portuguese love of a garden adds to the attraction
of their homes; grape vines are tastefully grown
where the Englishman would throw sardine tins; there
is a fernery in one corner of the garden, a rose bower in
another, luscious fruits and tempting vegetables grow
everywhere in exquisite profusion.</p>

<p>The Germans in Cameroons set aside a colonial fund
called the “Widows and Orphans Fund,” and I am told
it is from this capital account that men draw subsidies
with which to take their wives to West Africa!</p>

<p>One of the prettiest incidents I ever saw in West
Africa was at Victoria in the German Cameroons. The
planter came galloping home from the plantation, and
giving a whistle to announce his return, a daintily dressed
little matron skipped out lightly to meet him, and arm
in arm they walked into a charming little bungalow gay
with fern and flower. A few minutes later I passed by
the open door and caught a vision of a snowy table
cloth, bright with polished silver and glass. I could not
help contrasting this with the British factories with
their more or less dilapidated dwelling-houses, most of
them very dirty, and the general atmosphere in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
with the slatternly black woman leaning against the
cook-house door.</p>

<p>Recreation in some more healthy form than cocktails
and billiards is of no less importance than the well-ordered
house. In many colonies now there are golf
and cricket clubs, but these are only possible in the
more civilized towns where there is a considerable congregation
of whites. The man who suffers most from
fever and despondency is the one stationed at some
isolated post of the hinterland. Happy, indeed, is the
man with a knowledge of, and love for, a garden; it
will keep his mind calm, provide him with healthy
exercise, and a supply of fruits and vegetables which will
keep him in good form for his daily routine.</p>

<p>Given a good home, sound mental and physical
recreation, short periods of service with proportionately
shortened furloughs to Europe, the white man’s burden
in Africa, to which so many succumb to-day, would be
materially lightened, and both white men and women
could go forth with a fearlessness which, tempered with
care, would largely remove from West Africa the stigma
of “the white man’s grave.”</p>

<span class="smaller">LIGHTENING THE WHITE MAN’S BURDEN</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Chamberlain, a great stimulus was given
to the work of rendering the burden of West Africa
somewhat lighter. At his inspiration men began to
study more seriously the question of dwelling houses,
the use of medicines, and the supply of fresh food.</p>

<p>Sir Alfred Jones, Messrs. John Holt and Messrs.
Burroughs &amp; Wellcome, have each in their respective
spheres spent large sums of money experimenting in
various directions, in the hope that science applied to
the practical side of daily life and travel would ameliorate,
if it did not remove, the distressing effects of malaria.</p>

<p>The trader of twenty years ago lived—but more
frequently died—in a wattle and daub house. These I
know from experience can be made comfortable, but
more often than not they are so damp and insanitary
that fever may be looked for every few months. Inside
two and a half years, I experienced no less than seventeen
fevers, the majority of which were I am convinced entirely
due to the wretched habitation in which we lived.</p>

<p>To-day few men live on ground floors, for the mud or
bamboo house has given place to the airy bungalow
fashioned on brick piles, permitting a current of air to
pass beneath which keeps the house dry and sanitary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
It also has the not inconsiderable advantage that snakes
and other reptiles which abound in the tropics do not so
readily find a lodging as in the mud and sun-dried brick
houses of the earlier days. Another improvement which
is yearly growing in favour is that of gauze doors and
windows which give some protection from the torment
of mosquitos and tsetse flies.</p>

<p>On the island of Principe, the doors and windows of
almost every house are fitted with gauze, the object of
which is to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness which
has of recent years overwhelmed that island. The
germ-impregnated fly is nowhere in Africa so numerous
and vicious as upon that wretched Portuguese island,
where few of a ship’s passengers care to land, for the
risk of becoming inoculated with sleeping sickness is a
very real one. Whilst on that island we had to keep
an extremely vigilant watch upon the terrible tsetse flies
which gave us no peace, so anxious were they to taste
our blood. The fly, which is found in most parts of West
Africa, is most prevalent in the Bangalla region of the
Congo and on Principe Island. In the latter place they
literally swarm. There is no buzz to warn of their
approach, and usually the first intimation the traveller
has of their presence is the sharp stab, followed by acute
irritation and swelling. In spite of the precautions taken
on Principe, there seems very little hope that the population
can be saved from this terrible scourge. In one
month (June, 1910), out of a population of 4000 souls,
no less than fifty-six perished from sleeping sickness; that
is at the rate of 168 per 1000 per annum. No wonder the
Portuguese population is leaving the doomed island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MOSQUITO-PROOF SHIPS</div>

<p>An experiment which is being watched with keen
interest is that recently made by Messrs. John Holt &amp;
Company. The directors of this enterprising firm have
recently placed two insect proof ships on the West
African sea and river journeys. The first of these, the
“Jonathan Holt,” was launched in July, 1910. This vessel
was constructed largely under the advice of the Liverpool
School of Tropical Medicine, and the object was that of
rendering the passengers and crew immune from the
germ carrying mosquito. The “Jonathan Holt,” the first
of the type ever built, is about 2500 tons and with a dead
weight capacity of 2350 tons. She draws only 17 feet
6 inches of water, which permits navigation on the
river Niger and also allows her to reach Dualla, the
capital of German Cameroons.</p>

<p>The doorways, portholes, windows, skylights, ventilators
and passages are all protected with mosquito
gauze frames easily adjustable. Double awnings are
provided and everything which human forethought can
do to render the ship proof against the mosquito has
been done.</p>

<p>To Messrs. Burroughs, Wellcome and Co., every
African traveller owes a debt of gratitude. The excellence
and portability of their tabloid-preparations have
gone a long way to minimize the dangers of tropical
adventure. During our travels of over 5000 miles
we carried with us a medical outfit which left nothing
wanting, either for ourselves or for our paddlers and
carriers. For fever, for cuts or bruises, or other inevitable
ailments of the tropics everything was at hand;
nothing was lacking for the whole caravan and yet the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
total outfit weighed less than twenty pounds! How
great a difference a Burroughs, Wellcome portable outfit
would have made to Livingstone’s hard life. We carried
another case of “tabloid” photographic materials, and
with these developed nearly a thousand plates. The
whole outfit, both medical and photographic, was easily
carried by one boy.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to the European that African
travellers and writers lay so much stress upon the question
of food supply. West Africa for years exacted a terrible
toll from her white residents, which might have been to
a great extent minimized had they been able to provide
themselves with palatable fare. The late Sir Alfred Jones
determined to do something to make the life of the African
merchants and officials more comfortable in this respect.
He fitted out a few ships with refrigerators and began
in a small way to send some of our staple articles of diet
to the leading ports of the coast. Men and women too,
sick almost unto death, unable to eat the coarse bread,
the tasteless fish, or the tinned mixtures, were then
cheered and in numberless cases restored by the timely
arrival of an Elder Dempster boat with sterilized fresh
milk, eggs, chicken and mutton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FISH, FLESH, AND FOWL</div>

<p>Only too well do we remember those days, fifteen
years ago, when once on board the ship at Liverpool,
the travellers said good-bye to European diet. How
different the case now! Directly the ship casts anchor,
coloured messenger boys, and more often the white men,
come on with orders for beef and mutton, eggs and milk,
chicken and sausages, even game and fruit. It is a great
day when Elder Dempster’s boats steam into port,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
hurried invitations go out for dinner and luncheon
parties, and once a month at least the pale-faced commercial
agent or the anæmic government official is able
to enjoy a meal or two which puts new life into his tired
body.</p>

<p>Over and above the provisions for the passengers on
the steamer, each ship will now carry for sale—beef,
lamb, mutton and kidneys; pheasants and other game;
eggs, sausages, fresh butter and sterilized milk; potatoes,
carrots and onions; kippers, bloaters and salmon;
grapes, pears and apples—a veritable combination of
shops, butcher, dairy, greengrocer, fishmonger and
fruiterer!</p>

<p>Usually each ship will carry for sale from 1000 to
2000 lbs. of beef, a couple of thousand eggs, three or four
hundred pounds of butter, five hundred blocks of ice and
three hundred pints of milk. Festive seasons, too, are
not forgotten and Christmas boats carry a large stock of
turkeys and geese.</p>

<p>Think for a moment what a blessing the monthly
visit of a ship like this is to such foodless places as Boma
and Matadi in the Congo, the island of Fernando Po,
the isolated merchant houses of Rio del Rey, or the ports
of Spanish Guinea;—the drawn and sickly faces of the
men who come off for provisions tell their own tale.
They can not only buy all they want, but at a reasonable
price. The Belgian in the Congo buys beef cheaper
than he can in Antwerp, <i>i.e.</i>, 10<i>d.</i> a pound. Lamb and
steak he can get at 1<i>s.</i> per pound. The Scotch engineer
running his steamer up and down the Ogowé can get a
whole box of Aberdeen haddies for 5<i>s.</i>, or salmon at 2<i>s.</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
a pound. Ice can be purchased at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a half-hundredweight
block. Potatoes and onions at 9<i>s.</i> a case.</p>

<p>This enterprise of Sir Alfred Jones has already
developed into the creation of cold storage companies
at ports like Lagos, Calabar and Seccondee, and the
firm of Elder Dempster has now built chambers on some
of their ships capable of carrying twenty tons of European
provisions every week to Seccondee alone. The health
of West Africa, bad though it is, has greatly improved
within recent years, and though, of course, the medical
profession has so largely contributed to the change, the
house-builder, the merchant and the ship-owner have
loyally co-operated in an endeavour to lighten the
burden of the white man in West Africa.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="II_III">III<br>
<span class="smaller">GOVERNMENTS AND COMMERCE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Nothing in West Africa is more striking than the attitude
adopted by the several colonizing Powers towards commerce.
At present, Germany is easily in the front rank;
her policy towards business men is the most enlightened
of any Power, and it is therefore to be the more regretted
that her treatment of the natives is not equally far-sighted.
Were it so, all students of African questions
could view with equanimity her gradual absorption of
the whole of Equatorial Africa.</p>

<p>The British merchant knows with absolute certainty
that he may rely on receiving a warm welcome and every
assistance in German colonies. He knows, too, that
none will be given a preference before him. He knows
that if “public good”—the stick which governors so
frequently wield—demands the removal of his factory,
or that a road must be driven through his ground, the
German Government will not quibble over doubtful
legal points, but will look at the question on broad lines
of common-sense policy.</p>

<p>Steam into a German port, and before you cast
anchor you may see the customs and health-officers with
their launches racing across the intervening stretch of
sea. Promptly and smartly the doctor steps up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
companion-way, and you begin unloading your cargo
without further formalities. Your cargo finished, there
is no delay about papers, no irritating objections about
the closing time of the customs, or the doctor being at
dinner or more likely, tennis. Contrast this with a visit
to a French or Portuguese port—you may wait an hour
before the health-officer comes on board. His visit over,
the ship’s officers and native crew slave throughout the
day to unload the cargo, so that they may have the
valuable night watches for steaming to the next port,
but if the Frenchman can by any quibble keep you
tossing at anchor, you may rely upon his doing so.</p>

<p>The German neither likes nor dislikes the British
merchant: he is concerned with one thing only—that
British capital and British brains are good for his colony;
therefore, without any sentimental nonsense, he gives
the Britisher a warm welcome, and sees to it that no
preference is given to the German merchant, which
might make the British firm hesitate to invest further
capital in a German colony.</p>

<p>Of course the regulations in German colonies are
numerous and enforced with military precision and
sternness. The native, centuries behind the white man,
does not bear the strain very well. The Britisher, after
a time, learns that such regulations are for his good and
accepts them. No merchant at first takes kindly to
keeping his back-yard free from refuse; if he is in
Togoland he resents the first instance upon which
he is fined twenty marks for leaving old tins, half-filled
up with rain water, lying about the rear of his
store, but when in the process of time he is still without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
fever, he sees the advantage of this anti-mosquito
regulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODEL TRANSPORT</div>

<p>In Lome the Germans have an extremely interesting
and unique system of transport enterprise. The surf,
as in many parts of West Africa, is extremely bad, and
for years constituted a source of perpetual loss, not only
of valuable cargoes, but of human life. With characteristic
thoroughness the German, at great cost, ran a
pier out to sea, built a railway line on it and extended
this line along the front of the merchant houses—a
distance of about 1½ to 2 miles. On the pier the Government
erected seven powerful steam cranes. Having laid
down this plant, they took the next truly Teutonic step
and compelled all the merchants to accept Government
transport.</p>

<p>An outward-bound steamer is sighted at sea, cranes
are prepared, the health-officer leaves before the ship
comes to anchor, papers are examined, cargo is rapidly
placed in the surf boats which are towed across to the
pier where, in an almost incredibly short space of time,
fifty tons of cargo are hauled up on to the pier, put on
the train and delivered at the merchants’ doors. A
similar method is adopted with a steamer from the
south—homeward bound. The moment the look-out
ascertains her name and destination, he signals or telephones
to the merchants, and shortly afterwards trains
are in motion collecting the cargo already prepared for
the expected vessel. When she comes to anchor, her
surf boats are despatched to the pier, where they are
promptly loaded and sent back to the ship.</p>

<p>There is a scientific air about the whole transaction;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
an absence of fuss; an attention to business quite refreshing
in tropical Africa, and above all, there is a sort
of “hey presto” promptness in the way these tons of
pots and pans, bales of cotton, barrels of oil and bags
of corn are handled.</p>

<p>All merchants, of whatever nationality, must accept
this transport and pay a fixed rate of 11<i>s.</i> a ton, which
covers all costs and insurance against every risk. In
return they are saved the expense and trouble which
attaches to the upkeep of boats, boat-boys and a large
staff of men for handling cargo. I was assured by the
merchants that the system works extremely well, saves
them much annoyance, and, on the whole, does not work
out at much greater expense than the rough-and-ready
methods of other colonial ports.</p>

<p>The administration of German colonies is decidedly
autocratic, although not more so than in British Crown
colonies. In German Cameroons, however, all interests
are consulted in a manner which demonstrates the
eagerness of the German Government to keep on good
terms with the merchant. Twice, sometimes three times
a year, the Governor holds an enlarged “Colonial
Council,” to the deliberations of which he invites not
only the principal merchants, but the leading missionaries.
I was informed that at these meetings the Governor
welcomed criticism of existing or projected enactments,
no matter from what quarter they came, and that the
result was that everyone felt himself to be an integral
part of the colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH ATTITUDE</div>

<p>How different the French Administration! The
<i>Entente Cordiale</i> may be all right in the Banqueting Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and as a pin-prick for Germany, but it is time the British
people questioned its value in things that count. The
truth is that in French colonies, merchants of other
nationality are not wanted. Wherever you go in French
West Africa, the merchant is full of grievances with regard
to the petty annoyances of the Government and the
officials. Nor does this apply to West Africa alone;
the same story is told in Madagascar and the New
Hebrides, in both of which places, not only is the merchant
entirely <i>de trop</i>, but the <i>Entente Cordiale</i> has not even
secured decent treatment for the devoted missionaries.
The <i>Entente Cordiale</i> was not brought about for selfish
ends by Great Britain, and considering the much advertised
generosity of our partner, we have a right to
expect at least ordinary civilities in her colonies. The
French are so absorbed in themselves that they would
have none but Frenchmen on the face of the earth.
As Napoleon failed to accomplish this end, the present-day
Frenchman will not, if he can help it, have any but
his own nationality in French colonies.</p>

<p>The Portuguese want British capital, but they don’t
want British merchants; they kill the commerce of
British firms by every form of preferential treatment.
Their right to do so is, of course, equal to that of a man
to cut his own throat. The only British enterprises in
Portuguese West Africa are the Lobito-Katanga Railway,
the Angola Coaling Company and some electrical works
at Catumbella. The first named is the well-known
Robert Williams’ project for reaching the Katanga and
Northern Rhodesia from the West Coast. The local
Portuguese would probably like to strangle this valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
undertaking in its infancy, but they see already how
much capital is finding its way into Angola. When
Robert Williams gets his railway through to Katanga,
the Angola colony will become an asset of considerable
value to the Republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BELGIAN ATTITUDE</div>

<p>The attitude of the Belgian Government towards
commerce is again different from that of any other
colonial administration. Theoretically, the Belgians are
anxious to persuade capital to enter the colony, but the
principles of King Leopold’s rule have taken such firm
root that in practice the presence of any commercial
agents, particularly those of any other nationality, is
gall and wormwood to the local Belgians. Nothing, for
example, irritates them so much as a reminder that by
the Berlin Act they are bound to keep the country open
to the free commerce of the world.</p>

<p>Even Belgian merchants complain of the treatment
they receive at the hands of the officials of the administration.
Recently, when calling at Stanley Pool on
board a merchant steamer, we had to pass the customs
official. We put our anchor ashore in front of the customs
house, where the official himself was standing on the
beach smoking a cigar, and, as we thought, waiting to
examine our papers. He knew the captain (a Belgian)
was pressed for time, yet he deliberately kept the ship
at anchor for twenty minutes whilst he finished his
cigar! No doubt this conduct was meant to—and, of
course, did—impress the crew, but, as the captain remarked,
the reason at the back of such action is the
desire of Belgian officialdom to monopolize transport,
and their hatred of any form of free commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>I was present on another occasion which instanced
Belgian desire to secure trade in principle, whilst unwilling
to put their advertised desires into practice by
exhibiting a readiness to render real assistance. There
came into Boma a British ship, whose captain was of
higher rank than those usually visiting this port; it
was in fact the first time this officer had called at a port
so insignificant as Boma. He ran his ship alongside the
pier, but was amazed to find none of the ordinary preparations
for unloading cargo. Instead of sending a
ship’s officer for an explanation, he went himself to see
the quasi-Government Railway Company.</p>

<p>“Where,” he asked, “are the railway trucks for unloading
cargo?”</p>

<p>“There they are,” laconically replied the official.</p>

<p>“But I want them at the ship,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the official, with genuine courtesy,
“you can take them, I don’t object.”</p>

<p>That it was in any sense the man’s responsibility to
send these trucks along did not occur to him, and upon
the captain asking how he was to get them over the
intervening half mile of line to the pier, he was told,
again with every courtesy, “send your crew to push
them!”</p>

<p>Then might be seen the spectacle of a ship’s officer and
a gang of Kroo boys spending hours under a tropical sun
straining and tugging at these unwieldy railway trucks,
all of which could have been shunted in a few minutes
with ease by any one of the idle engines in the sheds.
That a ship of 5000 tons was delayed for twenty-four
hours by this stupidity was immaterial to the Belgian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
official. How differently the German would have acted!
The empty trucks would have been ready on the pier,
a shunting engine with steam up standing by directly
the steamer began making her way alongside, but the
Belgian is not cast in that mould.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BRITISH ATTITUDE</div>

<p>In British West African colonies the relations between
Government and Commerce are unique. Alone among
the Powers she has developed a caste attitude, until
to-day the distinction is not a little embarrassing. The
British official is quite a good fellow when you get him
alone, but, as a class, they form a distinctly objectionable
“set.” This is apparent the first day on board ship,
when the “sorting out” commences, and if the weather
is good this process provides not a little amusement to an
observant passenger. Usually there are but three groups
of travellers on a “coast” steamer—the official, the
merchant and the missionary. As we have travelled
a good deal in these ships, many occasions have presented
themselves for watching the arranging and rearranging
of this little floating town. The last time we
set out from Liverpool was the most entertaining of any.
Running down the channel, a youth, who had apparently
never travelled before, wished me “Good day,” with the
apparent intention of pacing the deck, but upon his discovering
that I was neither an official, nor a missionary,
he inwardly argued “a trader,” and promptly made off!</p>

<p>Another and yet another pursued the same tactics,
until by a process of elimination they “discovered” the
officials. “Steward” was then called and all the “official
chairs” were placed in a semi-circle in the best part
of the deck. That this monopolized the only comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
section of the upper deck did not appear to concern
these gentlemanly youths.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus31" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus31.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">CATARACT REGION BELOW STANLEY POOL, BELGIAN CONGO.</p>
</div>

<p>In the dining-saloon the chief steward had placed us
at one of the lower tables, but learning from the captain
of certain instructions given him by one of the Directors,
with whom I was on friendly terms, this man came
forward and with profuse apologies asked me to accept
an entirely different place in the saloon, saying that he
“thought I was a trader!”</p>

<p>Once I met a young Sierra Leone merchant, who
told me that a certain official in the Protectorate had
been taken ill with a bad fever at his factory; that he
had nursed him through it with all the care of a relative;
that this official, when he was at last able to leave,
appeared deeply grateful for all that had been done for
him, and the merchant believed he had made a lifelong
friend. A few months afterwards business called him to
Freetown, and passing along one of the streets, he met
two or three officials, one of whom was the friend whom
he had so carefully nursed. To his amazement, he only
received a curt nod and a plain intimation that further
intercourse was undesirable. It is to be hoped that such
conduct is rare, but the general attitude of the younger
British officials is becoming almost intolerable.</p>

<p>This treatment of the merchant class finds no place
in any other colony of West Africa. It is of quite recent
growth and monstrously unjust to the merchants, for it
should never be forgotten that it is almost entirely to
the merchant and missionary communities that Great
Britain primarily owes her presence in West Africa.
There is another fact our officials would do well to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
remember, namely, that the natives and the merchants
together pay their salaries and pensions.</p>

<p>The younger officials make themselves far more
objectionable than the older men, but probably this is
due to their inexperience. It is, however, regrettable
that the older officials do not set a more pronounced
example in the other direction. Within recent years,
the British Colonial Office has been sending out, in the
capacity of Assistant District Commissioners, many
youths of necessarily immature judgment and totally
lacking in experience. These lads are by far the worst
specimens in their attitude towards the native and
merchant communities. Recently, this feature has been
impressing itself upon travellers in East as well as in
West Africa. Mr. E. N. Bennet, in his book on the
Turks in Tripoli, says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Amongst our fellow passengers to Marseilles
were eight young men who were on their way to
Uganda. Few, if any of them, had ever crossed
the Channel before; they wore school colours and
did not know an olive tree when they saw one.
Nevertheless, they held, and expressed, very
decided views—the ideas of the College Debating
Society and the London Club—that the ‘man on
the spot’ must be the sole arbiter on matters
colonial and that kindness was absolutely wasted
on black men; the one ethical quality necessary
in a representative of Great Britain was firmness....
They also viewed with disfavour the deportation
of Mr. Galbraith Cole. One could only hope
that when these inexperienced youths grew older<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
they would grow wiser. As it is, an immense
amount of harm is done all over our vast Empire
by some of our younger soldiers and civil servants,
who, utterly devoid of <i>cosmopolitanisme gracieux</i>,
treat their non-English fellow subjects with a
contempt which would be ridiculous if it were not
dangerous.”</p>

</div>

<p>The merchant seeking a new field for commerce in
West Africa will find the warmest welcome and the fairest
treatment in German colonies, and next to Germany, in
this respect, the British colonies; there is not much to
choose between the Belgian and the Portuguese. None
but Frenchmen should go to the colonies of “Liberty,
Equality and Fraternity,” for there is little Liberty,
less Equality and no Fraternity in the French colonies
for white or black.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="II_IV">IV<br>
<span class="smaller">THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It is useless to close our eyes to the fact that an evil of
fearful potentiality is being introduced and fostered all
down the West Coast of Africa. I have not always
found it possible to agree with the much-criticized Native
Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee, but it must
not be overlooked that some of their critics have made
errors, in judgment at least, not one whit less extraordinary
than those which have been brought against
that Committee of highminded and unselfish men.</p>

<p>The greatest mistake made by people in Europe
upon this question is that of comparing it with the
European consumption of alcohol. The African is not
a drunkard in his primitive state and he detests our
ardent spirits; once in an extremity I gave a young
man a sip of brandy in water from my medicine case,
and he literally howled over it and set his teeth firmly
against my trying to give him another dose!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MERCHANT AND THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC</div>

<p>The error to which most people cling so tenaciously
is that of the “scoundrelly merchant” theory. They
cannot understand—because they do not know Africa—why
a merchant should pour gin into West Africa, unless
he is making a fortune out of it. As a plain matter of
fact the merchant makes less out of the sale of alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
than he would out of almost any other article of commerce.
In a village store on the Gold Coast hinterland,
I found rum costing 6<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a gallon being retailed at
7<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>—a profit of only 6<i>d.</i> per gallon. In another store
I visited, the native merchant was retailing gin at 9<i>d.</i> a
bottle, for which he was paying 8<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> per dozen, and
4<i>d.</i> a case for transport to his store. A West African
merchant once remarked to me, “If you could stop the
demand for intoxicating liquor it would pay me to give
you twenty thousand pounds.” The merchant was
quite right, because, whilst he could get fifteen and
twenty per cent. on the sale of Manchester cotton goods,
he was only making a few pence a case on the gin he was
shipping to Lagos! The sale of alcohol does not pay
the merchant, but we cannot escape from the fact that
it is a good revenue producer.</p>

<p>There seems to be a general impression that the
British administrations are the worst in this respect, and
that their record is not without fault few would deny,
but I am confident that the moral sentiment of the
British Government and people will save them from falling
so low as the French administration—an easy first in
almost all that is retrograde in Equatorial Africa. France
to-day recognizes the terrible evils which follow in the
train of Absinthe-drinking in the homeland, yet she
can calmly look on whilst natives stream into the little
drink stores of French Congo with their 25 cent pieces
to purchase “nips” of what I was assured by the
vendor was the worst form of drink in the whole of the
African continent. When we were at Gaboon, an
official informed me that quite recently two young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Europeans had taken to drinking trade Absinthe, and
in each case had died in a manner which called for a post-mortem
examination, the results of which horrified the
examining doctors.</p>

<p>The Portuguese have long been regarded as by far
the worst sinners, but it is the fashion in West Africa
to place every sin at the door of that not unkindly nation,
yet however deeply they may have sinned in the past,
there are happily signs of repentance and reform. In
Angola the Government has recently decreed the abolition
of distilleries throughout the colony, providing, out
of their extreme poverty, considerable sums as compensation
for the manufacturers.</p>

<p>The Belgians lead the way among the colonizing
nations in West Africa, for in their colony they are
bringing the prohibition line ever nearer the coast and it
is now impossible even in the “open” areas for a native
to purchase any intoxicating liquor between Friday
night and Monday morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“BANKING” SPIRITS</div>

<p>If the natives as a rule dislike alcohol, if the natives
of West Africa are less drunken than Europeans, what
happens to this ceaseless and increasing flow of spirits
into the West African colonies? “Over one million
cases of Hamburg spirit are retailed to the natives here
by a single firm within a year.” Such was the remark
passed by a dispassionate Government official to me
when in Southern Nigeria. There are twenty or thirty
big merchants in Lagos alone, who handle huge consignments
of this spirit by every steamer. Sitting on
the banks of the Lagoon, one sees an endless stream of
small craft passing to and fro with their loads of gin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
going to a hundred different centres, some with only six
cases, others with fifty and even one hundred. I visited
a farmer up country, who admitted to me that he retailed
over £1000 worth of gin and rum every year. The
same story met us at Abeokuta, where something like
thirty-three per cent. of the imports are spirituous
liquors, and the returns published show that in the month
of January, 1911, out of a customs revenue of £2644, no
less than £2450 came from duty on spirits.</p>

<p>None deny, because they cannot, this prodigious
importation of spirits into the Gold Coast and Southern
Nigerian territories; but one thing baffles every observer—where
does it go? The Egba and Yoruba people of
Southern Nigeria are not drunken. We could find very
few white people who had seen any appreciable degree
of drunkenness; generally it was suggested that drinking
took place at night. In order to test this theory, I went
several times, at a late hour, quietly through the lowest
parts of Lagos town. I saw many things, some of an
appalling nature, but no single drunken man or woman
could I find, and the statistics for convictions barely
show one per thousand of the population.</p>

<p>Yet we cannot escape from the official figures. Over
six and a half million gallons of spirituous liquor of
European manufacture were imported last year into the
British colonies of Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the Gold
Coast.</p>

<p>What happens to this increasing stream of spirits?
No one has ever been able to give a satisfactory answer
to the question. Some say that being a currency,
millions of bottles of gin are “banked,” <i>i.e.</i>, stored;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
some say that large quantities are consumed at festivals;
others assert that it disappears in secret drinking. I am
inclined to think, however, from visits paid at all hours
to the people’s homes, that spirit drinking is spread over
a much wider area than has hitherto been thought; that
is to say, moderate drinking prevails widely, but that
at present few of the natives drink to excess. If the
moderate drinking of to-day is leading the people to
drunkenness to-morrow, then a catastrophe of first
magnitude will fall upon West Africa. Drunkenness is
admittedly on the increase in the Gold Coast, and this is
so obvious that three years ago the Governor sounded a
warning by saying that he recognized drunkenness was
becoming one of the most dangerous enemies to
Christianity.</p>

<p>What is to be done? Everyone admits that the
sale of intoxicating liquor to natives (many would also
add—and to whites) in Africa is an evil; all are agreed
that the danger is potential rather than actual. But
very few seem to have any other remedy than—repression,
prohibition, high licenses, heavy duties; these are
the methods which find greatest favour to-day.</p>

<p>Prohibition is an extremely difficult proposition for
any African colony, and it is well-nigh impossible where
the French and German boundary lines march with
that of another colony. If, for example, Great Britain
proclaimed prohibition for the Gold Coast, what guarantee
have we that German native traders would not smuggle
spirits across the Volta into the Gold Coast, or the French
traders carry it over the Dahomean border into Southern
Nigeria?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIGH LICENSES AND DUTIES</div>

<p>High license and import duties have both been tried,
and both failed to check the growth of imports. In
some places, it would seem that these very restrictions
make matters worse. I was informed by a white doctor
on the Gold Coast that chiefs in the hinterland will take
out a license sometimes of £50, or even higher value,
but will impose a tax of 5<i>s.</i>, or more, per head, on the
entire community to pay for it. My medical friend,
who was a man of long experience and wide knowledge,
further said that many of the people resented this tax
because they were abstainers, and on that ground complained
to the District Commissioner, but the only redress
they obtained was, “Call it a loyalty tax then,
and pay it!”</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see what would happen if
the duty as a prohibitive measure were temporarily
removed. I do not think it is altogether clear that it
would tend to increase the consumption; one thing is
certain, it would cause something like a financial panic
amongst those natives who, holding large stores, hope
that the agitation in Europe will enhance the local price
and thus make possible extremely profitable sales of
stocks.</p>

<p>There are two spheres of action entirely untouched
to-day. West Africa is a very “dry” place indeed, and
the thirsty inhabitants must have some beverage other
than water. Palm wine used to be the national beverage,
but the demand by Europe for the products of the oil
palm is so great that the whole strength of the tree is
required for producing vegetable oil.</p>

<p>The other sphere of operation is beyond question the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
most effective—an internal movement against the consumption
of, and trade in, spirits. Repressive measures
by Governments are all very well in their place, but
without the goodwill of the people those measures cannot
be wholly effective. An agitation locally kept up with
the vigour that characterizes the campaign in England,
would do an enormous amount of good.</p>

<p>For generations past we have been telling the native
that he, in his primitive state, is everything that is bad.
Certainly the African, modelled upon a combination of
the reports of travellers, officials and missionaries, is a
creature the devil himself would disown. Unfortunately,
the native has, to some extent, come to believe this, and,
abandoning his native rôle, has struggled to imitate the
whites who, he has been taught to believe, are the highest
type of civilization. When, therefore, the white man
ships his gin to the African, he considers it the “correct
form” of the higher civilization to purchase it, and copy
the European to the extent of drinking “gin and bitters,”
“gin and water,” “whisky and soda,” “cocktails” and
other liver petrifying abominations, forsaking his simple
draught of water and his kola nuts for the drinks that
help him up to the standard of his inexorable critics and
overlords.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FORCE OF EXAMPLE</div>

<p>The Governor and his officials can, if they like, do
more to stop spirit-drinking than all the prohibitions,
taxations and high licenses that the wit of man could
impose. Is it impossible for one colony to set an
example? I think not, for I believe the British officials,
as a whole, in spite of their shortcomings, are capable of
making any sacrifice for the good of the colonies. If a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
governor would “set the fashion” and by his example
inspire his subordinate officers with a determination to
refuse to drink any intoxicating liquors in public, at
any function or ceremony whatever, for a period of
three years, and thereby set the fashion against spirit-drinking,
I venture to predict that within those three
years the import of spirits would decrease by at least
one half. The natives, rightly led by the Press, and
the movement supported by the officials and by the
ministers of the native churches, would take fire, so to
speak, until the drinking of spirits would become “incorrect
form.”</p>

<p>In the hands of the Government officials is the
power to turn the natives by example against the consumption
of ardent European spirituous liquors. Will
they seize the opportunity?</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="II_V">V<br>
<span class="smaller">THE EDUCATED NATIVE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The man who would understand the African must get
beneath the surface, otherwise he will never know the
real sentiments of the native races. By confining himself
to the hospitality of the whites, he will learn a great deal
about the natives, and will also learn to appreciate the
position of the merchant and the administrator, but if
he would probe the mind and thought of the African, he
will find no better way than that of living with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATIVE HOSPITALITY</div>

<p>It is of course more congenial—to many essential—to
accept the hospitality of trader or official, for there
are little things a native host and hostess will inevitably
forget; but the compensations! What a wealth of
affection, courtesy and native lore is poured at the feet
of the visitor.</p>

<p>Driven by fierce tornadoes, wet, cold and utterly
miserable, I have sought the simple hut of the forest
hunter, or the fishing-shed on the banks of an African
river. How warm the welcome! How quickly the good
wife will bring forward native refreshment! Let a drop
of rain find its way through the roof into the hut and
on to the white guest, and nothing will stop the impetuous
host from dashing outside in the foulest of weather to
stop the leakage. Readily, too, he gives up his rough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
bed and will curl up in the hollow of a tree, or beneath
its branches, joyfully enduring any discomfort so long
as the white man may be made comfortable.</p>

<p>It is the same at the other end of the scale. Those
who discover that terrible disease—negrophobia—creeping
over them, often in spite of the better self, will find an
infallible cure by staying for a few days with some
leading educated native. Their view-point will almost
unconsciously change under the genial and enlightened
conversation of the dinner-table; their hostility will
melt away under the influence of the natural courtesy
of the warmhearted host. They will begin to marvel
that some things should never have occurred to them
before, and, unless race prejudice closes the observant
mind to all reason, the guest will forget that his host is
an “accursed educated African.”</p>

<p>The “educated negro” is to many only a worse evil
than the primitive savage, but what has the educated
native done? What terrible crime has he committed?
I admit he has imbibed the education European civilization
provides, but is that a crime? I admit that he is
probably a greater consumer of spirituous liquor than the
illiterate native, but if it is wrong for the native to follow
in the footsteps of his white exemplars, why does the
white man import it? I admit that he is often overdressed
in too demonstrative European clothes, but
again, if it is wrong for him to wear these things, why does
European compete with European in producing the
liveliest patterns in clothes and the most outrageous
collars and boots? If these are the things which make
the educated native unfit to live, why send them to him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>I am not here concerned in condemning the sale of
European outfits, importation of spirits, least of all
European education, but in fairness to the African, let
us brush aside unreasoning and unreasonable prejudice
and put ourselves in his place for a moment. Let us
at least recognize for example that if grave faults
exist in the educational systems we provide for Africa,
it is upon us, rather than upon the African, that the
responsibility rests.</p>

<p>We all agree that the educated African has his weaknesses,
and pretty bad ones too, but though I have met
hundreds of them, though I have read volumes of
material they have written, I have never met one who
claims the perfection in life and conduct that not a few
of his critics assume. It seems to be mainly in British
colonies that the educated native is such a bugbear, and
if our educational system produces such evils, it is done
after all under an autocratic and not a representative
Government. Surely, therefore, we should lose no time
in abolishing, root and branch, the cause of the mischief.</p>

<p>But is it a failure? If so, wherein has the African
failed? Take first the elementary curriculum of mission
and Government schools. Where would Africa be to-day
without its thousands of coloured clerks and Government
officials? In Southern Nigeria alone there are 5000
natives in the British Government service, all of them
more or less educated. In every colony, too, you meet
cultured natives trained at these schools who are now
devoting their lives to the education of the rising
generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDUCATION AND THE AFRICAN</div>

<p>We are told that the education of the African has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
been too largely concentrated on a purely literary and
spiritual curriculum. Beyond question there is some
force in this criticism, but the Missions and Governments
are surely more responsible for this than the natives
themselves. The Government particularly so, for
missionary committees are after all only trustees for the
funds placed at their disposal, and such are almost entirely
given for purely missionary propaganda. But even this
criticism is unjust in ignoring the existence all over
West Central Africa of the educated native carpenters,
bricklayers, engineers on steamers, engine drivers and
guards on railway trains.</p>

<p>Crossing the Kasai territory I met an American
Bishop, who had also travelled not a few thousand miles
in Central Africa, and this charming old Divine could
not cease exclaiming, “Well, the way you English
are covering this continent with educated native
carpenters, bricklayers and engineers is just marvellous.”
Go where you will, you meet these men. In the upland
cocoa roças of San Thomé, in the workshops of German
Cameroons, in the trading factories of almost every island,
you will always find the Accra or Sierra Leone trader
and mechanic who has received a fairly liberal general
education at the mission schools. A thousand miles
north in the Congo, away south towards Rhodesia, you
will hear frequently the welcome salutation, “How do
you do, sir!” Welcome then indeed is the claim to one
Throne one Empire; more welcome still is the kindly
assistance with baggage, the clean hut, the generous
gifts of fruit and provisions.</p>

<p>“May I pay you for your kindness?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir, I am too glad to see you. God bless you,
sir. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>The traveller thus refreshed goes on his way and vows
that when he gets home he will send a subscription to
those missionary societies who are sending forth this
stream of men to the distant parts of the dark
continent.</p>

<p>The principal openings for the sons of native chiefs
are the medical and legal professions. First let it be
remembered that the enlightened chiefs fortunately
saw that by giving the flower of the race scientific European
education the power of the witch doctor, who,
throughout African history has been both medical and
legal quack, would be broken. Not only so, but the sick
and afflicted among the race would receive the best
alleviation that science could provide.</p>

<p>Has the coloured barrister failed? If so where?
Certainly not in British examinations where brains and
energy provide the only standard. I shall probably
be told by the critic that he has failed in practice. If
this be so, how is it that whenever a Crown case comes
along the British Government promptly briefs leading
native barristers?</p>

  BRITISH GOVERNMENT.</p>
  <p class="caption">(Dr. Sapara is endeavouring to persuade the natives to
  adopt attire more suited to Tropical Africa than the frock coat and silk
  hat of the European.)</p>
</div>

<p>Has the doctor failed? Again, where? Not in the
English and Scotch hospitals, for he has frequently
carried a higher degree than he finds amongst his European
colleagues when he returns to the coast. That he
is excluded from Government service proves nothing,
except perhaps prejudice. It may be asked why in the
Gold Coast colony the African medical man is allowed
no place in Government service. We are told in reply,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
because white men, and more particularly their wives,
would refuse to receive treatment at the hands of coloured
medical men. This argument fails entirely when we
remember that the majority of the hospital patients are
not white, but coloured, and at present can only receive
treatment from white doctors. Moreover, do we not
know of white men, who, fearful of that rising temperature,
that throbbing pulse, unable any longer to bear
the suspense, have sent for a native medical attendant,
and under his kindly treatment have recovered, in some
cases to remember gladly the skill exhibited, but in
others, alas, too easily to forget that they owe their lives
to such tender ministrations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NATIVE DOCTOR</div>

<p>Then, too, are there not to-day many white men on
the coast who prefer native doctors—whose names I
could mention—to the services of European medical
men? Have we not heard and known of something
still more eloquent—the calling in of native medical men
to white women? Many a white merchant and Government
official has taken out a delicate and highly-strung
wife to assist him in his work, and almost every
“coaster” knows how one of these heroic women was
stretched upon, apparently, the last bed of sickness;
the distracted husband had tried everything, had implored
the white doctor to try something—it hardly mattered
what—to give back health to the sufferer. Suddenly
a thought occurred to him! The native doctor, fully
qualified, was sent for and visited the patient, and then
in consultation with his white colleague, other treatment
was tried. Slowly the sick one fought her way back to
life and health, and to this day the husband remembers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
to whom he owes the restoration of one who to him was
everything—and this is no isolated case.</p>

<p>When death’s angel looks in at the window, which
is pretty often in West Africa, race prejudice shamefacedly
slinks out through the nearest doorway.</p>

<p>The administrator, the missionary, and the native,
however, realize that the educational facilities at present
at the disposal of the natives are not ideal; the march
of progress has shown defects, and these must be remedied.
If there is one administrative problem in British colonies
important above another, surely it is that of education.
In all things colonial, Great Britain has hitherto given a
lead; let her maintain that proud tradition by appointing
a commission to study the whole question of the education
of the African peoples in her Equatorial possessions,
with the object of ascertaining how far the Government
may be able to secure a more even balance between the
literary and technical training of the natives; how far
it may be possible to so re-adjust existing systems as to
avoid denationalization; how far it may be possible to
extend that supremely important but largely neglected
branch of education—practical agriculture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDUCATIONAL GRANTS</div>

<p>Then there is the question of Government grants.
Can anyone defend the antiquated system which prevails
in many colonies of giving lump sums of revenue to
missions? An excellent departure from this rule has
been commenced in the Gold Coast, whereby the missions
receive a grant per capita for the finished product, <i>i.e.</i>
when a scholar reaches a given standard in literary and
technical knowledge, the Government makes a definite
grant of from 20<i>s.</i> to 27<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for each scholar attaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
to that standard. This experiment, already fruitful of
so much good, might provide a model for other parts
of the African continent. A commission could study
how far this should be extended and whether it might
be wise to lead on to scholarships for an extension of the
education by providing grants for the study of agriculture
in the botanical gardens and plantations of the tropical
world. For example, if facilities were provided certain
natives from the Gold Coast would derive great benefit
from a study of cocoa plantations in different parts of the
British Empire.</p>

<p>If race prejudice were too strong to admit of this
procedure within the Empire, then such natives would
undoubtedly benefit by a visit to the plantations of other
Powers, in particular those of the Portuguese on San
Thomé, where, although there is predial slavery, no race
prejudice exists which would prevent a close study of
one of the finest systems of cocoa production in the world—certainly
second to none in West Africa.</p>

<p>Another problem which knocks loudly at the door of
the British Colonial Office for consideration is that of
Africans seeking a legal and medical education in the
Mother Country. We cannot, and have no right to object
to their doing so; on the contrary, we ought to welcome
the idea, to be proud of the fact that our Administrations
are so progressive that they help this movement forward.
But we are not; we do not like some of the results which
at present attend this practice. Again, I ask, are we not
responsible? These young men at a most receptive age
come in all their enthusiasm to the Motherland of their
dreams; they expect to find a civilization, but one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
remove from the realms of eternal purity and bliss,
and what do they find? No strong and friendly hand is
outstretched to help them, no responsible person comes
forward to take them by the hand and bring them in
touch with the better elements of our national life. Alone
in London or Edinburgh they drift into the worst channels
and imbibe the most pernicious ideas and practices that
float around the parks and parade themselves in the
streets of our great cities. What wonder that their
lives are fouled? Who can be surprised if the only
seeds they carry back to the colonies are those evil ones
which produce a crop of tares to the embarrassment of
the Government?</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AFRICAN ALONE IN LONDON</div>

<p>Philanthropy can do much to turn the thoughts of
these young men into loftier channels, but philanthropy
should not be left to do this work alone. Surely the
Colonial Office, if it has no duty in the matter, at least
for its own sake could render some assistance in giving
these young students a closer knowledge of the men,
the aims and the desires that inspire British Administration.
In the whole world there is collectively no
finer group of officials than those in the service of
Downing Street; some seem to think they too closely
resemble highly-specialized machinery; some of us know
otherwise; some of us know that behind the official mask
there are men whose hearts and consciences pulsate
with lofty principle and humanitarian sentiment. Yet
between this wealth of goodwill and experience, and the
African youth amongst us, a great gulf is fixed; there
is no medium of friendly intercourse between these noble-minded
officials and ex-officials of the Government and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the young Africans who are being trained to mould the
character of their compatriots and of public opinion in
Britain across the seas.</p>

<p>John Bull must wake up to the existence and the needs
of these children, must realize that their education,
whether in the colony or in the Mother Country, is of
supreme importance, and that the friendly and wise
oversight of their education is an Imperial responsibility
of the highest order. It is more, for all nations have
looked to us in the past for the solution of these problems,
and upon such facts—rather than upon a colossal navy—rests
the real strength of Great Britain.</p>

<span class="smaller">JUSTICE AND THE AFRICAN</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The Powers of Europe—and Great Britain in particular—boast
of the “justice” with which they treat native races.
Happily the native tribes, as a whole, fully share this
complacent belief in European rule, and this no doubt
arises from the fact that before the Powers of Europe
divided Central Africa between them, justice, as compared
with might, had but a small place.</p>

<p>This belief, however, is perceptibly passing away,
and in many of the West African colonies the natives
are not now prepared to accept, without question, the
acts of European administration. To such an extent
has this feeling grown within recent years that administrative
action sincerely taken in the best interests of the
natives is frequently assailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITISH JUSTICE</div>

<p>No one would deny that blunders are but human;
few would deny that the finest Colonial Office in the
world—that of Great Britain—has made mistakes which
subsequent history condemns. The natives have enough
common-sense to make every allowance for such mistakes,
but what they do not understand—and in this they are by
no means alone—is, why recognition of the mistake is
not made promptly, and some reparation made for the
error. The plain man asks why there should be some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Medo-Persian law which forbids the admission of error
and the consequent refusal of reparation. This attitude
is accountable for much harm to the prestige of the
European in West Africa.</p>

<p>In Government despatches, in speeches, in our schools
and from our pulpits, we are never tired of preaching
upon those articles of British political faith which know
no party. We pride ourselves upon our love of justice
and freedom, and yet we do things which we know to
be utterly indefensible, which we know to be in entire
contradiction to our belauded principles. We have made
the blunder and we know it, but we invariably crown it
with the further blunder of refusing to admit it.</p>

<p>We know perfectly well that it is indefensible to arrest
a man and arbitrarily punish him without trial, but it
is done, nevertheless. During our journeys in Central
Africa, we visited a grey-haired old chieftain living in a
hut on the Gold Coast. The old man was reclining in a
cheap deck-chair, he was totally blind and unable to stand.
What was his story?</p>

<p>Some thirteen years ago he heard rumours of a
rebellion against the British Government in Sierra Leone,
and immediately Bai Sherboro sent a message to the
District Commissioner that the war boys were bent on
attacking Bonthe. This timely information permitted
of measures being taken to protect Bonthe. One day
a messenger called upon Bai Sherboro and told him the
Governor wished to see him. Trustingly the old man
picked up his staff and went to the British authorities,
when, without trial—and he asserts without being even
informed of the charges made against him—he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
forthwith exiled to a lonely spot on the shores of the
distant British colony, the Gold Coast. In Sierra Leone
the old man had a son, who, refusing to allow his father
to go forth alone, sold all he had and joined him in
solitary exile, and who to this day shares his loneliness
and sorrow.</p>

<p>The British Government does not deny the facts,
but, apparently acting upon the advice of the “man on
the spot,” who has probably never seen any other person
than the old chief’s interested accuser, takes up the
position that the return of this blind and decrepit old man
to his native home, would be dangerous, on the ground
that he was believed to be implicated in a rebellion!
The Government has all along refused to give the old man
a trial, so that he might face his accusers and meet the
charges, with the result that he must die in exile. There
is something very un-English about such an incident.
Strangely enough the old man still holds firmly, after all
these years, to his admiration of British rule, and faith in
British justice. Again and again he reiterated to us the
words, “If only the King of England knew!” “If
only the King of England knew!”</p>

<p>This is a passionate loyalty which surely we are unwise
to trifle with, unwise to immolate upon the altar of
theoretic administrative infallibility. It is folly to bury
our heads in the sand so that we may not see these things,
for if we fail to look these facts squarely in the face,
others are regarding them—our friends with deep
concern, our enemies with the keen relish of an insatiable
hatred.</p>

<p>Will it be argued that this is only an incident?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Possibly, but who knows? This case was unknown to
the outside public until the old man’s hair had whitened
and until he had lost the use of his limbs during
ten years’ exile. Two years of persistent knocking
at the door of the Colonial Office has even failed to
secure permission for the old man to return to die in his
own country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PATERNAL DREAM</div>

<p>Many chiefs and native merchants in British West
Africa have but one ideal for their offspring—to send
them to England for an education either for the bar or
for the medical service. They are pathetic stories which
some of these men tell you of how they deny themselves
and their families so that they may save enough to send
“my eldest” to England. They themselves have only
heard of the glories of England, they can never hope to
see them, but their determination is that the boy shall.
The latter comes and spends his four or five years here in
England, possibly more, and during that period the old
man is slaving away on his farm, or trading early and
late in his store, has watched his savings trickle away
until often he has but little left. At last the glad day
of home-coming arrives. The lad steps ashore from the
boat, a fully fledged “medico,” carrying “no end of big
degrees.” How proud the father is! How amply
repaid he feels for all his efforts and struggles, as his full-grown
son explains to him the degrees he has obtained
are higher than those of Dr. Smith, the white medical
officer at the hospital.</p>

<p>The young medical man hopefully sends in his request
for an appointment in the Government service—an
appointment which must be paid largely from native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
taxation. At a later date he receives an official envelope,
which he greedily tears open in the presence of the
expectant and admiring family. It is the official form,
intimating that his services are not wanted!</p>

<p>We all know the reason, why wrap it up in gentle
phraseology, the hideous fact is there—the medical
service is the monopoly of the whites. Of what avail
are degrees of the highest order? What use is it to argue
that native medical officers would be less costly? The
colour-bar is thrown across the threshold of opportunity
in the Gold Coast. The young man himself understands,
possibly he may even come to hate the Administration
which appears to hate him, and can we be altogether
surprised? The old father does not understand it, he
is bewildered—the blow that has fallen upon his hopes
is a heavy one, and in spite of himself he wonders what
is amiss with British justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPROPRIATION</div>

<p>The island of Lagos, measuring less than 600 square
miles, with a population of nearly 80,000, was always
congested, but never so badly as it is to-day. By day,
and also by night, I have traversed the native quarters
and found overcrowding which before long must produce
a grave condition in that hub of West Coast commercial
activity. Lagos is always hot, always humid, always
malodorous to epidemic point, but Lagos, overcrowded
though it was, has within recent years seriously added to
its congestion by the forcible expropriation of some
hundreds of people from the lands they occupied. No
doubt a nicely-laid-out race-course is more pleasing to
the eye of many British officials: the brightness and
neatness of this fenced park is cheering to those who now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
have a monopoly of this vicinity, but the price paid for
such expropriation is a further alienation of native
loyalty and goodwill. Somehow the native does not like
being driven from his home, even though “Hobson’s”
compensation is provided.</p>

<span class="smaller">RACE PREJUDICE</span></h3>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">RACE PREJUDICE AFLOAT</div>

<p>The most lamentable feature which confronts the traveller
in British West African colonies to-day is that with the
growth of commerce on the one hand, and with the spread
of Christian thought on the other, race prejudice is
rapidly increasing its hold not only through an ever
widening area, but in an intensity which must before
many years have passed precipitate a grave condition
in the relationship of the two races. The decks of West
African liners provide an incomparable mirror for reflecting
white opinion upon the shortcomings of the black man.
On shore each man is busy with his own affairs and
usually meets only men of his own circle, but on board
ship one meets every class; moreover, the conditions of
travel tend to facilitate a flow of conversation. One sees
stretched upon the deck, in every conceivable attitude
of comfort and discomfort, all classes of the coast community:
the dapper little colonel; the young district
commissioner; the army doctor; dealers in oil, ebony
and rubber; the Nimrod going out in search of big game,
and the missionary going forth in quest of human souls.
These varied interests cooped up on the decks under the
enervating influence of the tropical sun will with some
exceptions share little in common, but that of an indefinable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
dislike and contempt for that black man they come out to
govern or exploit. To the student of human affairs, the
conversation is of absorbing interest, revealing as it does
every type of thought and superficiality. The loquacious
trader, with the experience of but one term, opines with
a lofty air that the “nigger” is the very embodiment
of Satan. The “gentle” wife of Britain’s representative
suggests that the sum of all evils—the native we have half-educated,
should be curbed by measures dear to the heart
of the short-sighted statesmen of Russia. The sympathetic
doctor, with ten years’ practice, looks on and holds
his peace, a silent but eloquent censure. The missionary,
with longer experience still, likewise says nothing, but
listens with pained interest. The deck below is filled with
the usual crowd of natives: the tall Fulani trader; the
squat Gold Coaster; the Christian servant from Freetown;
the devout Mohammedan merchant going up to Kano,
possibly on to Mecca. The mammies, too, are there,
dressed in skirts of brilliant Manchester print and gaily
coloured blouses, outrageous in fit and style. The piccaninnies
play their little games and romp round their
admiring mammies. Not infrequently a child stands
sadly apart, maybe a girl possessing but little in common
with the other children, her little head with its pale face
is covered with something half-wool, half-hair; she has
a father somewhere, possibly amongst that group on the
upper deck, but between upper and lower deck a ladder
is fixed, down which the white man may go whenever
desire prompts him, but up which neither coloured nor
quadroon may climb.</p>

<p>But what are these exceptional sins of the coloured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
man? What are these terrible shortcomings of which
he has the absolute monopoly and which call forth bursts
of passionate denunciation from the great men of the
earth? “An incurable kleptomaniac”—“unspeakably
immoral”—“grossly impudent”—“incorrigibly lazy”—are
but a few of the sweeping indictments hurled pell-mell
at the reputation of the absent and mainly defenceless
“prisoner in the dock.” Civilization, which has
never robbed the African of his land or its fruits, never
bought and sold him, never violated his daughters, but
has ever protected him, has ever set before him a perfect
standard of Christian practice, should examine these
whirling charges in the light of established facts. It
cannot be denied that the African frequently breaks the
eighth commandment, but there is some evidence that the
Almighty had the Anglo-Saxon race in view rather than
the African when He gave Moses the ten commandments
on Sinai’s mountain.</p>

<p>The following incident will show the prejudice to which
the African is subjected: Our vessel was pitching,
tossing and rolling her way down the West Coast, most of
her passengers too sea-sick to stir far from the upper
deck. A steward shuffled his way along endeavouring
to balance cups of chicken-broth to tempt the appetite.
One of the passengers helping himself, called attention to
the lack of spoons. The steward replied: “We are not
allowed to bring them, sir; you see there’s niggers aboard
this ship!” Though knowing perfectly well that the Kroo
boy may not intrude himself upon the upper deck, even
the steward seeks to make him responsible for losses more
properly attributable to the members of his own staff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">NATIVE OFFICIALS</div>

<p>The Post Office clerks at Sierra Leone, and Custom
House officials at Lagos, are cited as paragons of impudence
and “swelled head.” It must be admitted that
these men fully realize that they are servants of the
British Crown and maintain a dignity not altogether
appreciated by the white community. If they can be
accused of “swelled head,” may it not be that white
example has led them to regard such an attitude as
“correct form” for Government officials? Examples
of this may too often be seen in British Crown colonies,
for between the British official class and the merchant
community a great gulf is fixed, across which many officials
gaze with unbecoming contempt. Let the subordinate
native but ape this attitude, and, in him, it becomes a sin.</p>

<p>With bated breath and eloquent gesture, the frightful
immorality of the native is a morsel of scandal dear to the
heart of many superior whites. This is a matter, however,
upon which students of African social life have some
differences of opinion, but none have any such differences
of opinion upon the necessity of “Form B,” which so
many white officials are prone to forget. An exposure
of African immorality cannot, it is true, be long delayed;
sooner than most people think that day is coming. Locked
in the breasts of governors, doctors, missionaries and
educated natives are strange stories and appalling
statistics; their volume is daily increasing; facts are
being labelled and classified and these only await the
opportunity which an increasing virulence of attack
upon native immorality—ignoring that of the white
race which obtains in every African town—will precipitate.</p>

<p>The chief indictment against the African is that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
being incurably lazy. Prejudice has so blinded the eyes of
critics that they do not see the fleets of sail and steam craft
which the horny black hands send to and from the West
Coast laden with produce. Look over a single ship;
there are boat-boys, deck-boys, boys for cleaning brass,
washing plates and dishes, splicing ropes, hauling rigging
and painting ironwork. “Boys” for loading barrels
of oil, for towing and loading floats of giant timbers, all
of whom, more or less, keep the doctor busy bandaging
their crushed fingers and toes or sometimes their broken
heads. “Boys,” too, for delivering cargo ashore, through
the wild surf in which many lose their lives every year.</p>

<p>Those who have a leaning towards the “lazy nigger”
theory would do well to stand for a single hour at the
Liverpool docks and watch that unbroken stream of drays
heavily laden with tons upon tons of mahogany for our
tables; cocoa beans for our chocolates; rubber for our
motor cars; palm oil for our soap; kernels which presently
will find their oil labelled “fine salad oil,” or “rich
margarine.” The sundries, too, are there by the waggon
load; hemp and cotton, ground-nuts and skins, ebony
and ivory, a veritable river of produce flowing into the
heart of the British Empire without intermission.
Nothing can check that flow, nothing can stop its increase,
for it springs to-day from lands overflowing with forest
wealth; lands where natives are inured to the hardships
of labour, natives of infinite patience and withal the
world’s keenest traders. There is but one danger to this
increasing flow—race prejudice—which may, unless
checked, give birth to actions which will utterly shatter
African confidence in the British race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DAY OF RECKONING OR REFORMS</div>

<p>The critics of the African all agree that he has one
good point—“he takes his gruel like a man”—“flog
him when he is in the wrong and he won’t resent it;
flog him thoroughly whilst you are at it, and he will
even thank you for it.” If this doctrine should ever
firmly possess the minds of those whose duty it is to
administer West African colonies, the Governments will
be faced with a danger impossible to exaggerate. To
make this opinion an article of administrative faith is
to provide the white with a salve for every act of injustice
which irritating circumstances and climate so constantly
generate. In every colony in West Africa there are some
few white men who are wholly trusted by the natives,
and their homes and hospitality are at their disposal day
and night. Naturally these are the experienced men of
the coast, or those of repute amongst the natives; the
easy grace with which they move in and out amongst the
people at all hours, and in all circumstances, is demonstrative
of the confidence they enjoy. Discuss the
natives and the problems of administration with such
men and the furrowed brow wrinkles still more, and they
tell you a change must come soon, or—“Certain white
men would be wise to clear.” It is for statesmen at
home to recognize the danger in time and choose between
a day of reform or a day of reckoning.</p>

<span class="smaller">LABOUR—SUPPLY AND DEMAND</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Everywhere in West Africa the cry goes up, “Give us
more labour.” The British, German, Portuguese and
French merchants all declare that if only they could
get the labour, they might put a different face on the
whole of the problems of production in West Africa.
The principal reason for this shortage is unquestionably
the fact that West Africa is sparsely populated, but
this one fact does not, by any means, explain the
situation. In Liberia alone does there appear to be any
appreciable quantity of surplus labour, and upon its
resources considerable demands are made by other
colonies. This surplus obviously arises from the fact
that Liberia is completely undeveloped, but if in the
near future some energetic power should take charge of
that territory, a period would certainly be put to indiscriminate
recruiting amongst the native tribes.</p>

<p>It is true that in some territories in West Africa there
is an increase in the population, but taking the whole
areas into review, the labour force has seriously decreased
within recent years. Statistics, though at present little
more than estimates, go to prove that in several colonies
this falling off is becoming a grave question. Recently
the religious denominations in Lagos have been holding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
“intercessions” with reference to the high rate of
mortality. If this intercession should lead the natives
from faith to works, we may still hope to see the abandonment
of those European customs which are doing untold
harm to the physique of the native women and children.</p>

<p>The causes of decrease in the population, generally
speaking, are beyond human ken and one can only
express opinions which someone else will promptly
contradict. For example, almost every traveller wrecks
his reputation on that old-time rock of controversy—polygamy.
Sir Harry Johnston mentions in one of his
books the case of a polygamist with 700 children, but the
greatest polygamist I have ever met in Africa possessed
1000 wives, yet he had no children! Argument based
upon two such instances, however, is profoundly unsatisfactory,
because with so large a company of wives
in one case, and children in the other, it is obvious that
many other considerations repose beneath the surface.
There is one outstanding fact which everyone knows,
but few speak about except in whispers; human nature
is pretty positive in West Africa, no matter of what
hue the skin, and scientists may argue until eternity
upon the relative effects of polygamy and monogamy
on the birth rate, but all their deductions are wide of
the mark whilst they have so little actual monogamy
anywhere in West Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SLEEPING SICKNESS AND LABOUR</div>

<p>Sleeping sickness has made the most terrible ravages
wherever it has established a firm hold on the tribes,
but this scourge would seem to be spending its force.
Seven years ago Uganda recorded over 8000 deaths from
sleeping sickness within twelve months, and the latest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
Government report shows that there has been a gradual
reduction until in the year 1910 there were only 1546.
Happily this encouraging feature is present on the West
Coast also. The Congo suffered more than any other
colony, due, probably to a large extent, to the systematic
oppression under which the population groaned during
the Leopoldian régime. Now, however, the absence of
the scourge in many of the old districts is quite noticeable.
Villages that we knew to be swept by this plague ten years
ago are once more flourishing, and in some cases where
the birth rate was almost nil the villages are again joyous
with the laughter of little children.</p>

<p>The worst sleeping sickness areas remaining in West
Africa appeared to me to be the Bangalla region of the
Congo and the Portuguese island of Principe. In the
latter it has reached such proportions that the whites are
leaving the island. The Portuguese still keep a considerable
number of slaves on the cocoa farms, all of them
either infected or exposed to the disease. As one passes
from roça to roça, these slaves, stricken with disease,
with emaciated bodies and gaunt features, stare piteously
at the passer-by from eyes that seem to stand out from
their heads, mutely appealing for the freedom of their
distant village homes on the mainland. Looking at
the matter from the materialistic standpoint of labour-supply,
but makes this ruinous conduct on the part of
the Portuguese appear doubly reprehensible.</p>

<p>“Civilization,” too, has contributed to a decrease
in the working population, but in a varying degree. All
the Powers have sinned in this respect. I never read of
punitive expeditions with “many natives killed” without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
inwardly fuming at the folly of the administration which
should know how precious from an economic standpoint
alone, is the life of every single native. Yet in some
places the tribes are hustled, tormented and even
butchered in a manner little realized as yet by the European
public. Think of the loss of life by violent death
in both Belgian and French Congo, and in German West
Africa! Think of the countless thousands of bleaching
bones scattered over the highways through Portuguese
Angola!</p>

<p>Within the last twenty-five years well over 60,000
slaves have been shipped to San Thomé alone; add to
this the thousands sold and still in slavery on the mainland,
and you probably have a total of over 100,000
slaves passing into the possession of the whites in Portuguese
West Africa. That stream of human merchandize
involved a wastage of another 100,000 lives, for a Portuguese
slave-trader once admitted that if he got half his
total gang to the coast, he was lucky, but that generally
he could not deliver more than three out of ten!</p>

<p>It is a haunting thought that since the “85” scramble
for Africa, the civilized Powers who rearranged the map
of the African continent, ostensibly in the interests and
for the well-being of the natives, have passively allowed
the premature destruction of not less than ten millions of
people. Now these Powers complain bitterly that they
are short of labour and jump at any expedient which
presents itself to obtain labour for their hustling developments.</p>

  <p class="caption">COCOA FARM, BELGIAN CONGO.</p>
</div>

<p>The sins of King Leopold are visiting themselves
upon his successors in every part of the Congo basin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
The prospective gold mines, the cocoa farms, the public
departments, all of them are handicapped owing to lack
of an adequate labour force. If only the Belgians could
restore to life an odd million of the able-bodied men and
women done to death under the régime of their late
sovereign, what a different outlook their colony would
possess!</p>

<p>The Belgians now propose bringing Chinese for the
Katanga Mines, but seeing that their former experience
of Chinese coolies was not a happy one, and considering
other drawbacks, I very much doubt whether they will
ultimately launch the experiment of bringing thousands of
Chinese across Africa. The original idea of the Belgian
Government was that of bringing the coolies into the
Congo under a regulation which would secure their repatriation
at the termination of the contracts, coupling that
regulation with others similar to those adopted by Great
Britain in South Africa. Mr. R. C. Hawkin,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> whose
knowledge of South African politics is not only wide, but
intimate, at once pointed out that the Belgian Administration
was restricted by the Berlin and Brussels Acts.
This opened up a situation so obviously awkward that
nothing more has been heard about the introduction of
Chinese labour into the Congo, at least for the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT GERMANY LACKS</div>

<p>Germany, like Belgium, differs from France and
England in that she has no other colonies from which to
draw a labour force. Quite recently her colonists, at
their wit’s end for labour, passed a resolution agreeing to
import 1000 Indian coolies for labour in the mines. It
had not occurred to them that the British India Office<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
might object. How much trouble, to say nothing of
expense, they would have saved themselves if only they
had asked the office-boy in Downing Street!—they need
have gone no higher.</p>

<p>This is another instance of the strange features which
now and again attend German colonization, good as well
as bad. Their authorities had apparently entirely forgotten
the regrettable Wilhelmsthal affair, but probably
the real reason was that this incident (which many
Englishmen will not readily forget) was regarded by them
as altogether too trivial to be noticed. This unfortunate
affair—though in some respects comparatively unimportant,
yet in reality a grave matter—certainly
merits a permanent record in some form, because it is
just one of those blundering incidents which bring in
their train a whole crop of labour difficulties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ANGLO-GERMAN INCIDENT</div>

<p>A German Railway Construction Company had been
allowed to recruit British Kaffir subjects from South
Africa. In the autumn of 1910 trouble arose because
deductions were made from the labourers’ wages, and they
further complained of bad food and housing. The
Railway authorities seem to have then embittered the
situation by refusing to allow the men food and water.
This conduct in a tropical country was little, if at all,
short of inhuman, and the labourers naturally struck
work and apparently assumed a somewhat threatening
attitude. The situation was then handled in a style
characteristically German. The Company itself, ignoring
the civil authorities, called in the troops, who shot seven
of these British subjects in cold blood and wounded
several others. How one-sided the whole affair was is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
demonstrated by the fact that not a single German soldier
was even injured. This incident, from every point of view
an outrage, was regarded as so trivial that no one appears
to have been punished, nor so far as we know has any
compensation been paid to the wounded or to the relatives
of the murdered Kaffirs.</p>

<p>German colonial knowledge of British public opinion
cannot be of a very far-reaching nature when it ignores
this incident in asking for British labour to develop its
colonies. To Englishmen it cannot be a matter of
surprise that the India Office has not yet granted permission
to recruit labour from the Indian Empire.</p>

<p>Germany and Belgium are the only two Powers in
West Africa which do not possess colonies in other parts
of the world from which to recruit labour, hence they
are dependent upon other Powers. To the proud German
Empire, this situation is irritating, while Great Britain,
France, and also Portugal, to a limited extent, can each
of them augment the labour force of any given colony by
recruiting from their other colonial possessions.</p>

<p>The Portuguese colonies of Angola, San Thomé and
Principe, which comprise the major portion of Portuguese
West Africa, experience the greatest difficulty in
obtaining labour. It is perfectly true that during the
last half-century, close on a hundred thousand labourers
have left the shores of Angola for the cocoa islands and
other places, but these it must be remembered were almost
exclusively slaves which had been bought or captured
in the remoter regions of Angola, Rhodesia, Barotseland,
and, more especially, the Congo Free State. The
Portuguese colonists of Angola are so pressed for labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
that they started some years ago an “anti-slavery”
movement against the Portuguese planters of the islands.
No doubt there was an honest element in this movement,
but it is equally beyond question that the mainspring
of the movement was local anxiety to keep all the slaves
in the Angola colony, which is to this moment rotten with
slavery. If Angola, a territory more than twice the size
of France, were properly developed, it would require
first of all a complete abolition of slavery, and then an
immense augmentation of the labour supply. When we
were at Lobito, the Robert Williams Railway Company
and the Electrical Syndicate between them were at
their wit’s end for two thousand more men, but these
could not be obtained.</p>

<p>The two colonies of San Thomé and Principe are by
far the most serious problem. The area of the two
islands is not large—only 400 square miles together—but
they are extraordinarily fertile; the very air seems to
intoxicate with abounding fertility; everything flourishes,
cocoa, sisal and rubber; everything multiplies and
replenishes on the earth, but man; for some reason
there appears to be a curse upon those islands, they
are almost without an indigenous population and the
wretched slaves imported to fill the ranks die off like
flies. The future of the Portuguese cocoa colonies is
doubtful because it is obvious that they cannot be run
permanently by a temporary solution of the labour
question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BRITISH DEMAND</div>

<p>Both France and England at present manage their
labour difficulties with greater ease than any of the other
Powers, and this because both have a floating supply in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
their colonies, which, owing to the high standard of
colonial development as expressed in railways and
steamers, motors and good roads, is readily transferred
to the more needy districts. At the same time every
now and then we hear laments that expansion is rendered
impossible owing to the lack of men.</p>

<p>When Lord Sanderson’s Commission took up the
study of contract coolie labour, the areas appealing for
labour included the Gold Coast colony, and the Government
Secretary of the mines, Mr. Cogill, put in a plea
that the colony should be allowed to recruit labour for
its mines from India. In this plea he was supported by
Sir John Rodger and the Acting-Governor, Major Bryan.
This application is not easy to understand, for everyone
knows, or should know, that Indian labour generally
is unsuited to mining work. There is, however, some
reason to believe that the inspiration of this plea came
from sources requiring indentured labour from other
parts of the world, and that the demand for Indian coolie
labour was put forth in the hope of establishing necessity
and thereby paving the way for a less acceptable demand.</p>

<p>The bulk of labour in West Africa is employed under
indenture or contract, the majority of the latter being
for three years, but a great deal of unskilled labour is
employed on a yearly, or in some colonies—particularly
the Portuguese—a five years’ contract. The latter are
paper contracts, and in practice may mean anything or
nothing at all. Very few unskilled labourers in Africa
are prepared to accept willingly a single contract of longer
duration than one or at the most two years, and if a contract
system exists whereby labourers are bound for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
longer periods at a single service, it may be generally
assumed that some form of pressure or intrigue has been
at work.</p>

<p>Now that public attention is being focussed upon
labour conditions, it becomes increasingly imperative
that Governments should lay down the broad lines upon
which they are prepared to allow contract labour. Nor
must the labourer only be considered, the employer has
the right to be heard in framing such conditions. In
spite of much evidence to the contrary, I am still inclined
to the belief that, as a class, the employers of labour
everywhere in Africa detest as much as anyone labour
conditions which are unfair. Even the Portuguese
planters of San Thomé hate the slavery they practice,
but by a long series of blunders they have been led into
their present position.</p>

<p>The greatest care requires to be exercised if contract
labour is to be kept free from the taint of slavery. The
Indian authorities, in spite of every precaution, frequently
find that the most reprehensible practices attach to the
recruitment of labour for the East and West Indies. In
the African continent, where domestic slavery is so widely
prevalent, the need for watchfulness is a hundredfold
greater.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECRUITING</div>

<p>The conditions which govern the immigration of
indentured labour should differ but little from those
which cover local contracts, with the one exception that
local labour contracts should always be of short
duration—never longer than a year. Contracts for
over-sea labour must be longer to cover the cost of transport,
but even these are seldom satisfactory to either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
employer or employee for a period longer than three
years. The Jamaican and Fiji indenture, which in practice
involves a contract of ten years, is for many reasons
highly objectionable.</p>

<p>The chief danger is beyond question with the recruiters.
In India these men according to Mr. Broun,—an Indian
Civil servant of large experience—“are the worst kind
of men they could possibly have. They are generally
very low class men.” They seem to bribe, deceive and
bully by turns, anything indeed to bring the Indian
coolie into their toils. In Portuguese West Africa the
recruiter has for years been a slave-trader pure and
simple, purchasing slaves from the Congo rebels, and also
from the chiefs in the Rhodesian borderland. The
Portuguese Government has now issued a regulation that
all such recruiters must be duly licensed. In Belgian,
German and French colonies, recruiting is undertaken
very largely by Government officials.</p>

<p>Recruiting—whether by the irresponsible recruiter,
the licensed agent, or by the Government official—calls
for the closest attention of the Administration.
The official will demand from a chief, the unofficial
recruiter will bribe him for a given number of labourers;
in the former case the chief fears to refuse, in the latter
he becomes a party to a form of slavery.</p>

<p>The German official carries this operation through
with the least amount of sentiment. I asked a planter
in the Cameroons whether he obtained all the labour he
wanted with a fair amount of ease. He looked at me in
astonishment, and replied, “With ease, of course. I
only notify the Government that I want labour and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
bring it to me!” On another occasion, when I was
discussing Portuguese administration with a French
cotton planter from the Cunene, he began roundly abusing
the Portuguese Government, and upon my inquiring
wherein they differed from the German administration
across the river, he replied, “The Germans stand no
nonsense over labour. If the native villages are small
and distant from the planters, they just burn down the
villages and drive the natives nearer the planters. The
Government can then quite easily make a list of the
able-bodied men and supply them as they are required.”
How far this may be a general characteristic of German
treatment of native races, I cannot say, but what I have
seen of German colonial methods does not impress me that
their occupation is far removed from a sort of military
despotism. In the matter of official recruitment of
labour, the Germans are by far the most vigorous of any
of the West African Powers. In this official recruitment
the individual labourer concerned has very little say
indeed; that he should desire to enjoy his freedom is
apparently no concern of anyone, all he knows is that
he has to work for the white man for a given period,
and in German South West Africa the “contract” must
be made “as long as possible.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOMESTIC SLAVERY</div>

<p>The hardships of contract labour are greatly increased
by the prevalence of domestic slavery. We are sometimes
told that domestic slavery is inseparable from
native social life, and that from time immemorial it has
been an integral part of African law and custom. For
that matter so has cannibalism! There are many
apologists for domestic slavery, including students of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
such eminence as Mr. R. E. Dennett and the Editor of
the <i>African Mail</i>; the latter considers it would be
foolish to abolish the House Rule Ordinance—or in other
words the legalization of domestic slavery in Southern
Nigeria. It is difficult to understand how a man with
Mr. Dennett’s experience could possibly write the paper
on this question which was reprinted in a journal of
the Royal Colonial Institute. Mr. Dennett knows, or
should know, that the horrors of early history in the
middle Congo, the blood-curdling stories of Kumasi, the
present-day slavery of the Portuguese colonies and a
thousand other labour scandals rested and still rest in
the ultimate resort upon domestic slavery. The cheap
sneers at the sentimentalist, the innuendo that they are
mere stay-at-home critics is entirely misplaced and no
one knows this better than Mr. R. E. Dennett.</p>

<p>Domestic slavery is slavery pure and simple, although
I agree that under the African chiefs it may not be so bad
as under the old planter systems. Front rank statesmen
with large administrative experience have recorded the
lamentable results attaching to domestic slavery, and so
recently as 1906 Africa’s greatest constructive Administrator—the
Earl of Cromer—penned the following significant
passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the utility of the Soudan, considered on its
own productive and economic merits, is not already
proved to the satisfaction of the world—if it is
not already clear that the reoccupation of the
country has inflicted, more perhaps than any other
event of modern times, a deadly blow to the
abominable traffic in slaves, and to the institution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
of domestic slavery, <i>which is only one degree less hateful
than that traffic</i>—it may confidently be asserted
that we are on the threshold of convincing proof.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The broad lines of domestic slavery are common
throughout West Central Africa. The slave becomes the
property of the head of the house or chief, who can
“contract” him to third parties without reference to
the one primarily concerned, that is to say the slave
himself, who in turn cannot hire out his labour without
the consent of his master, and he may also be transferred
in payment of debt. Upon the death of the owner, the
slaves with their families—who are the property of the
chief—are divided amongst the heirs with other goods
and chattels of the deceased. The domestic slave can
by native law everywhere, and by European law in some
parts, be recaptured if he runs away. According to
British law the slave becomes the property of the master
in Southern Nigeria “by birth or in any other manner.”
This only legalizes native law, it is true, but “in any
other manner” throws the door widely open to a transfer
of human beings in a way highly repugnant to British
sentiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A REVOLTING CUSTOM</div>

<p>In the middle Congo a system is rapidly extending
which violates every moral code in that it is none other
than a wholesale prostitution. Under this custom,
known locally as that of the “Basamba,” a man hires
out a proportion of his wives on a monthly or yearly
agreement. The basis is the principle of absolute ownership;
a weekly or a monthly “hire” in cash, or its
equivalent, is paid, and all the offspring handed over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
to the husband and owner. Thus the owner, or husband,
obtains first a financial return for the hire of his surplus
wives, and secondly he claims the offspring. In the event
of males, they become domestic slaves, with which the
chief may satisfy administrative and other demands for
labour; while in the case of girls the chief possesses a
further source of revenue either by hiring them out to
“temporary husbands,” or by purchasing other and
older women for the same purpose. This method of
increasing the number of wives and slaves is by no means
limited to the middle Congo, but in no other part of
West Africa were we able to find it carried on so extensively.
In those regions it is quite common to find men
with ten wives hired out in the different villages, and a
few cases exist of men who now carry on their trade with
no less than fifty, and even one hundred, such surplus
wives!</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus34" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus34.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">A CONGO CHIEF WITH SOME OF HIS WIVES AND “BASAMBA” CONCUBINES.</p>
</div>

<p>There are other means of obtaining domestic slaves.
Many of them are, of course, “inherited,” and not a few
are passed over as part dowry with a wife; others are
taken for debt and some are captured in tribal warfare.</p>

<p>The relation between contract labour and domestic
slavery is more intimate than appears on the surface.
In West African practice an employer desiring a given
number of labourers invites or “calls” the chief whom
he informs of his requirements; if a merchant, he generally
accompanies his request for boys with a gift; if a Government
official, the demand more often than not is accompanied
by a threat. At a later date the chief returns
with the required number of labourers. If asked whether
they are willing to work, they generally assent, for they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
fear to oppose their chief who, even if European prestige
were not behind him, still possesses all the power of native
law and customs—to say nothing of the awe-inspiring
fetish.</p>

<p>Admittedly, however, normal domestic slavery in
Africa is widely removed from predial slavery with which
our school books made us familiar. Eliminating from
domestic slavery the sacrifices for which slaves were
always, and in some places are still, reserved; eliminating
also European demands for labour, the system is not
everything that is bad, nor are the chiefs invariably
cruel and despotic towards their slaves. It is nevertheless
equally true that the frequency of “palavers”
which deal with escaping slaves is an evidence that the
yoke of slavery is often intolerable, and that in spite of
native law, in spite of European law and practice, and still
more in spite of the fetish, the slaves attempt, and sometimes
make good their escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SLAVE CAPTURE</div>

<p>Over large areas in the British colony of Southern
Nigeria the police can, and do, recapture and restore
such slaves to their owners, and two years ago it came
as a shock to many that an escaping slave seeking refuge
on the deck of a British Government ship could be forcibly
recaptured and restored to his master; not only so, but
he was actually flogged by British police for running
away! It is, however, not altogether an easy matter to
secure recapture of runaway slaves under British law,
and therefore to the charge of “running away” is sometimes
added larceny—the theft of a canoe or a cloth;
the canoe, of course, being the boat by which the wretched
slave made good his escape, and the cloth that which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
uses to cover his nakedness. The following is a fair
specimen of the warrants issued for the recapture of
slaves in Southern Nigeria:—</p>

<p>The British Government alone amongst the Powers
in West Africa really dislikes this system and shows some
inclination to secure its abolition. The Portuguese like
it, and in the main descend to the level of it, manipulating
the system to suit, so far as possible, their labour requirements.
The Belgians cannot recognize it without violating
the Berlin and Brussels Acts, so they leave it alone to
bring forth a whole crop of abuses.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-Governor of French Guinea has
recently taken a strong line upon the question of domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
slavery, which other Governments might emulate. He
has issued instructions to all his subordinate officials in
which he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We cannot allow the system of captivity to
continue any longer; it is a matter of duty as
well as of dignity to put an end to the present
situation.... You are to profit by every occasion
which offers for making the captives understand
that it is immoral for one man to possess another....
Whenever you or your colleagues make a
journey you are to gather the natives together
and explain to them our wish.... In all cases
which are brought before you, you are resolutely
to refuse to examine those which relate to master
and slave; make them understand that for us
there are no slaves, and that in justice and law we
only admit the relations of employer and employee.
You are to follow up with the utmost rigour all
crimes committed against human liberty, and to
employ all the severity of the laws against barbarous
masters or slave-traders who are still too numerous
on the frontiers of neighbouring colonies....
Every captive who appeals to your authority is
to be welcomed by you and protected against
every abuse of force. You will disregard every
stipulation which in civil contracts, wills, etc.,
would postulate the condition of family captivity....
There are no longer any captives in Guinea—such
is the formula which must rule your conduct.”</p>

<p>If transfer to French Congo is a promotion, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
quicker the French Government promotes this enlightened
official to that sphere, the better for French reputation in
that unhappy region.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORCED LABOUR</div>

<p>In Africa forced labour, like contract labour, rests
very largely upon domestic slavery. What is generally
understood by forced labour is indistinguishable from the
corvée of Germany, or from that which obtained in
earlier times in Prussia and France. It is simply a
communal undertaking upon works of general welfare,
mainly roads from town to town, although the word
corvée was also applied to all feudal demands, but in those
cases some wages were given in return for the labour.</p>

<p>The old African communities exacted, and in many
cases still exact, labour from their domestic and agricultural
slaves for which they were and are paid, according
to the whim or the benevolence of the chief. This labour
was, and is, devoted to the clearing of paths, keeping
bridges in repair, gathering harvests, porterage, canoeing,
boat-building, and indeed any undertaking which involves
a considerable labour force. These exactions, however,
are always made at a time which avoids interference with
agricultural necessities; moreover, in the nature of the
case, the labour was never used very far from the village.</p>

<p>European administrations have stepped into West
Africa, and have taken the place of the chiefs, and in so
doing have adopted corvée under the plea of works of
public utility—a blessed phrase which covers a multitude
of questionable “necessities.”</p>

<p>In the Gambia every able-bodied male is compelled
under the penalty of a fine, or six months’ imprisonment,
to give labour for the construction of roads, bridges, wells<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
and clearings round the villages in his own district. They
must also provide carriers when required. Apparently
the Governor is the only arbiter of the time to be given to
such works and whether or not any remuneration may
be made. In Southern Nigeria the Governor may call
up all able-bodied males between 15 and 50, and all able-bodied
women between 15 and 40, to give labour upon
road-making and creek-clearing for a period of six days
each quarter. Refusal to obey involves a fine of £1 or
imprisonment not exceeding one month. Similar regulations
prevail in Northern Nigeria.</p>

<p>In German Togoland the natives must give twelve days
a year, or commute this by paying six marks; but the
labour can only be used upon roads and bridges in the
district in which the labourers reside. Almost identical
regulations prevail in the French and Portuguese Congo.
These regulations—<i>qua</i> regulations—are unobjectionable
and, after all, only assume powers exercised for generations
by the chiefs. In practice, however, under the term
works of “public utility,” frequent and irregular demands
are constantly being made to the irritation of the people.
Think of what a single punitive expedition involves—no
matter on how small a scale. Modern weapons of
warfare, ammunition, tent kits, provisions and the
thousand and one odds and ends of the modern paraphernalia
of war, all this is carried in the main by forced
labour. I shall doubtless be reminded that the chiefs
always exacted labour for war. That I admit, but
“civilized warfare” is so infinitely more elaborate than
the simple native spear and arrow warfare, that they are
not to be put in the same category.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Carriers too are demanded in numbers and for
distances which violate every native restriction. It is
but two years ago that a British official in Southern
Nigeria decided to start off upon a journey on Sunday
morning, and because the carriers did not come quickly
enough, he marched into the two nearest churches and
seized the congregations, including the native minister,
and to demonstrate further his petty authority and
repugnance of loftier ideals, insisted on this native clergyman
carrying a box containing his whisky. At this
distance it is the ludicrous which probably strikes the
imagination, but it is an entirely different matter locally.
The missionaries of Southern Nigeria, no matter what
their denomination, are of a very devout and noble-minded
order; they have instilled into the minds of the
natives a deep reverence of all things pertaining to
worship, and nothing will ever efface from the native mind
that—to say the least—irreverent conduct of the representative
of the Christian Government of Great Britain.</p>

<p>It is difficult sometimes to discriminate between
contract labour, forced labour and slavery, the boundary
lines having been obliterated by vigorous administrations
demanding labour for this and that work of public utility,
which in reality bear little relation to an enterprise for
the general welfare. In Belgian Congo this is carried
further than in any other West African colony. The
Belgians insist that there is no forced labour in the Congo,
and this is perfectly true from the legal point of view,
but nevertheless almost the whole administrative
machinery and Government undertakings are maintained
by forced labour. To roads and bridges Belgium has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
added telegraphs, mines, plantations, and recruitment
for the army; the ranks of both—labourers and soldiers—being
filled almost entirely by forced labour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BELGIAN FORCED LABOUR</div>

<p>Loud were the complaints made to us in our recent
journeys through the Congo of the incessant demands for
labour by the Administration.</p>

<p>Wearied with a day of struggle through Congo forests
and swamp, I was resting one moonlight evening in the
centre of a primitive Congo village; a group of native
chiefs were sitting round me discussing political conditions.
The absence of a certain token led me to question
one individual somewhat pointedly as to the cause.</p>

<p>“If I tell you, white man, you won’t betray me?”</p>

<p>“Your chief knows me well enough for that,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Well, there were eight of us,” he explained, “called
by Bula Matadi. We were bound to go, bound to leave
our wives and our children and go down river several
days by steamer. When we arrived, the head white
official gave us a ‘book’ (contract) for three years, and
sent us to cut a road for the ‘Nsinga’ (telegraph wire).
We worked for some days, discussing every night how
we could escape. One afternoon the white man went
into the forest and four of us who were working together
ran down to the river where we found an old canoe and
one paddle hidden in the grass. We crowded in and
pushed off, one guiding the canoe with the single paddle,
whilst the others paddled with their hands. We managed
to get into a creek hiding ourselves until the next night,
when, with the help of some stout sticks for paddles, we
began the long journey home, paddling in the night and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
hiding ourselves and our canoe during the day. We
lived on roots and nuts for eight days, and then, when
hiding in the forest, we heard some women talking we
‘frightened’ them and they fled, leaving their baskets
behind. These contained palm nuts, on which we lived
for another six days. On the fifteenth day we reached
home again, but our people did not at first recognize us.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because, white man,” chimed in the old chiefs,
“they were so emaciated that the flesh had shrunk from
their cheek-bones, their ribs stood out like skeletons,
and they could barely speak.”</p>

<p>Such is Belgian forced “Contract Labour” in the
Congo.</p>

<p>What are the boundary lines between legitimate forced
labour and that which public opinion, as trustee for
native rights, should refuse to tolerate?</p>

<p>The broad line of division is unquestionably between
genuine works of public utility on the one hand, and
profit-bearing works on the other.</p>

<p>Road-making, bridge-building, creek-clearing, are all
of them works from which the whole community benefits,
but the requisition of this labour should not be left to the
arbitrary will of a temporary official, but subject to
clearly-defined regulations. Any legislation upon forced
labour for works undertaken for the public good should
only permit the requisition, in lieu of taxation, as is the
case in German Togoland, where the native has the
alternative of paying a head tax of six marks per annum
or giving his labour for twelve days, subject to the labour
being required for the improvement of his own district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>As in Ceylon and other British colonies, the natives
should be allowed to commute the labour by a money
payment. To labour exacted under these rigid conditions,
there can assuredly be no strong objection, and,
generally speaking, the native tribes would loyally
co-operate in such proposals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORCED LABOUR AND PROFITS</div>

<p>To employ forced labour upon any kind of work which
carries with it a financial advantage partakes of slavery.
A merchant obtaining forced labour at his own price is
thereby, in principle, engaging in slavery, and if by
obtaining such labour he is able to enter into unfair
competition, he is further guilty of doing a gross injustice
to his fellow-merchants. The Belgians are extremely
prone to this form of labour. In the Congo there is a
good deal of State commercial enterprise, which may
yet ruin the individual merchant. The Belgian Government
is doing the larger proportion of transport on the
vast fluvial system of the Congo, and thereby competes
with the Dutch House and other transport companies.</p>

<p>These transport steamers are all driven with wood
fuel cut from the forests. Every few miles along the
banks of the Congo river there may be seen stacks of fire
logs cut into lengths of about eighteen inches, which
have been either cut by the employees of the Government
or by the villagers. No company is permitted to purchase
Government wood, and ordinary steamers purchasing
from the villagers have to pay 2 francs a fathom for such
fuel. Journeying down the Congo a few months ago,
three of us carefully examined conditions at one of the
wooding posts, manned by twenty-six men and ten
women, most of whom had been “demanded” from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
chiefs in more distant parts of the Congo, and drafted to
the spot in question. Several had already served three
years—the nominal term of the contract—but, without
any option in the matter, their contracts had been
renewed. Each of the men had to cut one fathom of
wood per diem; some were paid 7 francs and others only
5 francs a month, with a 3-francs allowance for food. The
maximum cost, therefore, was 10 francs for the thirty
fathoms of wood cut in the month. Thus the State
provides itself with wood at a fraction over threepence
per fathom, for which company steamers must pay
2 francs. Under such systems not only are human
liberties violated, but commerce suffers prejudice. There
is not a little danger that the Belgian authorities intend
giving a considerable extension to State enterprises, which
in all probability will be prosecuted with this form of
forced labour.</p>

<p>The question of State railways and telegraph lines is
a difficult one, both partaking of works of public utility,
yet both are as a rule profit-bearing. There is the further
consideration that all profits go to relieve local taxation.
Given representative Government or given even an elective
element in the Administration, there may be some justice
in imposing this form of forced labour upon the general
community, but under the autocratic systems of Crown
Colony Administration, large demands for forced labour
cause, not unnaturally, widespread disaffection. Fortunately
British colonies are almost entirely free from the
employment of such labour and to this no doubt is due
the excellent management of all railway systems under
British control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>The most economic and the most politic line to follow
is that of the employment of free labour. Supervision
is reduced to a minimum, abuses of authority are rare,
the work goes more smoothly, the song takes the place
of the boot and the lash, the native labourer goes home
when the day’s toil is over vowing vengeance on no one,
and the white man returns to his somewhat primitive
home with a mind undisturbed by conscious wrong-doing.</p>

<span class="smaller">LAND AND ITS RELATION TO LABOUR</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It will not, I think, be contested that throughout West
Africa there is no native conception of private ownership
of land. This is almost an article of religious faith
amongst the African races generally. Let one tribe
murder a member of another community and a palaver
will be called and compensation paid. If wife-stealing
or kidnapping of boys takes place, the tribes involved will
remain calm and settle their dispute by making peaceful
and honourable amends. Let one tribe exploit the palm,
or without leave settle on the lands of another, and, on
the instant, the ultimatum is despatched—“Depart
forthwith, or accept the alternative!” Indeed the occupation
of the communal lands of another tribe is recognized
by most tribes as an overt act of warfare, the signal
that all negotiations for peace are at an end.</p>

<p>Perhaps no more eloquent testimony of the attachment
of native tribes to their lands is to be found anywhere
than in the great Equatorial regions of the Congo.
The early ’eighties witnessed in the Congo basin three
convulsive movements; the entrance of the white man
from the west, following on Stanley’s journey across the
continent; the incursion of the Arabs from the north,
and the Lokele wars towards the south. This latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
movement was destined to change the whole situation
in the Equatorial regions, south of the main Congo.
The Lokeles, probably pressed by the Arabs from the
north, started a “land war” with their southern neighbours,
the object being to obtain an extension of tribal
land. This pressure set in motion a land war, which
ultimately extended over an area nearly five times the
size of Great Britain and ran right through the south
reaching down to the Lukenya river, and in some places
even across the greatest of the southern tributaries—the
Kasai. Tribes fought each other for the maintenance
of their ancient boundaries until the whole of the Equatorial
region was in a state of warfare, which only ceased
when starvation claimed victims by the thousand. Then
only were boundaries re-adjusted by peaceful agreements;
even so the whole population for months was in such
dire straits for food, that men sold their wives, and
mothers their children, for a single basket of manioca.
One realizes how passionately the natives are attached
to their lands as they recount the horrors of those terrible
years. Said one to me recently—“At first we fought
to protect our lands, but in the end we had to fight to
obtain ‘meat’—human flesh—to stay the pangs of
hunger.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIXED LAND BOUNDARIES</div>

<p>The native boundaries are almost invisible to the
European eye, but to the African student of nature those
boundaries are fixed and immovable as the eternal
hills. The limits of tribal lands, within the orbit of
which the clans may move and hunt whenever they will,
are the stream, the palm plantation, the hilly range and
the bridges across streams and rivers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Upon the chief and his advisers devolves the sacred
duty of maintaining intact these tribal lands, alienation
being foreign to the native ideas. So jealously is this
guarded that many paramount chiefs in native law have
no power to grant even occupancy rights. For six months
the cession of Lagos to the British Crown was held up
because King Docemo had signed a treaty which appeared
to violate this principle of native law. The population
declared that the ownership of the land of Lagos was not
vested in the paramount chief, but in the seven White
Cap chiefs, who, fearing the terrible consequences of
alienating the tribal lands, fled to the bush. It became
necessary for the British representatives to give the most
explicit assurances and sacred promises on the point,
in order to secure the ratification of the treaty of cession.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that titles have been granted to
native tribes and to white men, but it is equally true that
originally there was never the remotest idea that this
involved the European conception of total alienation.
In the Holt <i>v.</i> Rex case of Southern Nigeria, the Crown
held that “under native law strangers cannot obtain
freehold rights—only occupancy rights.” The tribal
conception of occupancy rights also carries with it the
communal idea; a native clan settling by permission
within the territory of another tribe really constitutes
the first step in progressive incorporation. In the first
instance of white settlers, there are abundant stories of
the native interpretation of this principle—some of them
distinctly objectionable, although there were pure motives
behind them; others are amusing, such as that of the
chiefs “borrowing” saws, axes, string, rope, nails and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
what not. Again and again they have freely and openly
helped themselves to palm nuts and other produce from
the white man’s ground. No doubt much of what the
European calls “pilfering” was really quite innocently
founded upon the communal conception of the primitive
races.</p>

<p>The impetuous scramble for African territory, which
began thirty years ago, made, and continues to make, a
considerable breach in this old primitive system. White
men, acting through the doubtful medium of interpreters
not infrequently corrupted in advance, have secured from
chiefs titles to land of all dimensions. These chieftains,
as a whole, never fully grasped the meaning of the titles
obtained with honeyed words, and which they are now
unable to repudiate. That this is so is partly proved by
the fact that in some colonies areas have been conceded
twice and even three times over. Swaziland is, of course,
the most flagrant example, where it will be remembered
a situation so complex was created that it ultimately
became impossible for any Court to decide as to who
were the real owners of specific areas.</p>

<p>In West Africa things are not, and never can be,
quite so bad, although in some colonies, the Gold Coast
for example, German Cameroons and French Congo,
land difficulties are being piled up for the endless confusion
of future administrators. In Belgian Congo
there is no immediate probability of trouble, due partly
to the fact that capital has little confidence in Belgium’s
heritage, but more because the major part of the population
has disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAND AND LABOUR</div>

<p>There is a vital connection between land and labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
in all tropical and sub-tropical colonies. The economic
future of native races is immobilized in the proportion in
which their lands are taken from them. The almost
phenomenal success of the cocoa industry in the British
colony of the Gold Coast is due entirely to the fact that
the natives are the proprietors of the cocoa farms.
Throughout the colonial world, there is no more striking
contrast between a landed and a landless native community
than the British Gold Coast colony and the neighbouring
Portuguese colony of San Thomé. In both
territories cocoa flourishes, both produce excellent cocoa,
in both nature is very kind, but while the one will march
on conquering the cocoa markets of the world, the other
is doomed to ultimate disaster.</p>

<p>The San Thomé cocoa producer is only a labourer—in
fact a slave—and he is perishing at such a rate that
the depleted ranks must be filled from outside sources
to the number of 3000 to 4000 labourers every year.
This constant inflow of labour cannot continue indefinitely,
even if European sentiment permitted—which
it will not—the revolting concomitants by which this
labour has been maintained. The economic future of
these colonies from which the supplies are drawn will
soon forbid the emigration which at present is necessary
to the island of San Thomé The population of the Gold
Coast, on the other hand, happy in the enjoyment, in
the main, of its own lands, reproduces and to some extent
even increases itself every year. The native occupies
his rightful place as producer, while the white man finds
his true sphere, first as the inspirer of native efforts to
place on the market cocoa of increasingly good quality,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
secondly as the medium by which the cocoa produced is
conveyed to the manufacturer, and thirdly that by which
surplus European manufactures are brought to the door
of the native in exchange for his products.</p>

<p>This relationship of land to labour is receiving increasing
recognition by students of colonial policy. The
Republican Government of Portugal, finding both labour
and land problems in hopeless confusion in the African
colonies, has recently introduced a comprehensive measure
embracing both factors in the development of African
colonies. The ordinance is probably too generous in
proportions to be carried through effectively in any
colony, and stands little chance of complete application
in Portuguese colonies, which suffer already from an
excess of legislation, coupled with a rooted contempt for
“Lisbon dictation.” This new ordinance, however,
is a valuable contribution to West African legal
literature.</p>

<p>The Provisional Government first lays down the
proposition that every native in the Portuguese colonies
is under “a moral and legal obligation to work.” The
proposition upon land is in the following terms: “In
all the Provinces beyond the seas, wherever there are
public lands vacant, uncultivated, and not used for any
special purpose, natives may occupy and cultivate them
subject to conditions laid down in the present ordinance.”</p>

<p>The native in Portuguese colonies, therefore, must
work. The sphere of labour he may choose, but idleness
is henceforth a punishable offence.</p>

<p>Women, sick men, minors under fourteen years of
age, chiefs and those in regular employment, are either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
exempt from the operation of the ordinance or deemed
to have fulfilled its obligations.</p>

<p>Any native may contract his services, but, in the first
instance, for a period limited to two years. The agreement
is null and void unless the wages are fixed and
recorded in the contract. Any clause giving the employer
the right to administer corporal punishment likewise
renders the contract invalid. The engagement may be
made with or without the assistance of Government
officials, but any document signed in the presence of a
Government authority carries with it both the right and
the responsibility of official intervention in any subsequent
dispute between the parties. If, however, the
contracting parties enter into the agreement without
reference to the authorities, the employer cannot look
for official assistance in disputes with the employés,
although the latter under all circumstances may rely
upon official protection and assistance. All contracts
must bear the impress of the labourer’s thumb. Wages
may not be withheld, nor may pressure be exerted to
force merchandize upon the employé in lieu of wages.</p>

<p>Recruiting agents must obtain a licence from the
Governor of the province, and any infraction of this
section of the ordinance is punishable by a fine of £100 to
£1000. A heavier penalty still awaits any recruiting
agent who attempts to contract labourers for prescribed
regions: presumably that death-trap of Portuguese
colonies, the island of Principe. The punishment for
such violation may be imprisonment for one year, a fine
of £200, and at the expiration of the term of imprisonment,
expulsion from the colony. Similar penalties await any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
agent contracting labourers beyond the bounds of his
judicial area.</p>

<p>The Republican Government evidently realizes that
contract labour, however benevolent it may be made to
appear on paper, is not always a heavenly condition, and
that the labourer may repent of his bargain before
expiration. Section 18 provides for almost every concomitant
which attaches to restrained labour. The pill,
however, is sugared by a preliminary and somewhat
unctuous preamble, that the whole trend of employment
must be that of “moral education.” In pursuance of
this laudable object, powers of arrest are conferred,
“precautions” against running away are permitted, and
if a second offence occurs, the offender, “when caught,”
may be taken to the authorities “to be chastised.” There
are, however, certain limits to these powers, for the employer
may neither shackle nor chain an employé, nor
may he deprive the labourers of food, nor impose any
fines which involve deductions from wages.</p>

<p>If the native of the Portuguese colonies dislikes the
yoke of any master, he may, like Adam, “till the soil,”
for, as already stated, all vacant public and uncultivated
lands are at the disposal of the colonists. The first
general restriction is that this liberty is only open to
those “who do not possess immovable property to the
value of £10.” The object of this restriction is nowhere
elucidated, but apparently it is that of fixing the population
upon definite areas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEASEHOLD BECOMES FREEHOLD</div>

<p>If, then, the native does not possess immovable
property to that amount, he may occupy a piece of land
measuring 2¼ acres for himself, and an additional acre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
for every member of his family with the exception of
males above fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>A man with two wives, a mother, three daughters,
and also three sons under fourteen years of age, could
occupy under this regulation a little over ten acres, but
the occupation must be an effective one. A dwelling-house
must be erected, and two-thirds of the area must
be under cultivation, otherwise the title becomes void,
and the authorities will expel the occupants. The right
of occupancy is inalienable.</p>

<p>During the first five years of occupation, the colonist
is exempt from all dues, but at the close of this period
taxation is levied and may be paid either in cash or kind.
Failure to pay these dues renders the occupier liable to
eviction without any compensation for improvements.</p>

<p>After an occupation of twenty years, characterized
by the fulfilment of all legal responsibilities, the occupier
automatically acquires the freehold. These cultivators
or small holders are exempt from serving either in the
army or the police; they are likewise freed from any form
of forced labour, hammock carrying, or paddling, but
they are not exempt from taking part in military operations
with their respective chiefs, when such expeditions
are undertaken by command of the authorities.</p>

<p>District commissioners, civil and military officials
are urged to induce natives to avail themselves of the
land provisions, and are empowered to assign them plots
of land. They are also instructed to prepare local regulations
safeguarding the rights of the colonists, compile
land registers, etc., for which no fees are to be exacted
from the natives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>If a native will not labour for another, if he will not
sow a field or trade in produce, if in short he is only
prepared to stretch forth an unwashed hand and mutter
“Matabeesh, Senhor!” then the official representative
of the Government will deal with him. The danger is
that other than “wastrels” may be swept into the official
net, particularly whilst such operations are so highly
profitable to the Portuguese colonies.</p>

<p>First the delinquent is summoned to answer the charge
of idling without visible means of support; then the
paternal authorities are to read him a homily on “moral
education,” and forthwith despatch him to a place where
work is waiting for him. If he still refuses to work he
may be sent to “correctional labour.” There he will
receive food and lodging and be given one-third the market
rate of wages. “Correctional labourers” may, according
to Section 58, be hired out by private persons upon the
same terms as the prisoners of State. Such persons
willing to employ “correctional labourers” are requested
to make formal application, but only those are eligible
to receive such labourers who have never been convicted
in any court. If they receive such labourers a
given sum <i>per capita</i> must be paid to the State and a
fine of £20 paid for any shortage in “returns” alive
or dead, the number hired out must be returned to the
Authorities. If, however, escape is feared, the correctional
labourers may be returned to State prisons each
night.</p>

<p>If the whole ordinance is to be applied to the Portuguese
colonies in a measure of completeness hitherto
foreign to the Portuguese possessions, then there is some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
hope that even the leopard may be able to change his
spots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUMAN VALUES</div>

<p>There is little likelihood that the Portuguese land laws
will be rendered effective on the spot, especially when we
remember that many thousands of miles throughout which
such laws are intended to operate are not yet under any
sort of administrative control. The step which is finding
most favour in British West African colonies is that of
declaring all lands, whether occupied or not, as native
land under some sort of ultimate trusteeship of the
Governor for the benefit of the natives. No purpose
can be served by denying that this would place very large
powers in the hands of a single individual, even though
the powers so conferred may only be exercised “in
accordance with native law and custom.” It would
beyond question give to the Governor powers which in
the hands of some individuals might be exceedingly
dangerous.</p>

<p>The majority of British Governors of Crown colonies
could undoubtedly be allowed to supersede the paramount
chiefs in every respect, providing the constitution of the
Crown colonies permitted the bringing into full play
of this one vital condition, viz. that his actions would
always be “in accordance with native law and custom,”
but Crown Colony government excludes at present any
form of representative government which is the unwritten
law of every African tribe.</p>

<p>Docemo, and his successor Prince Eleko, in Southern
Nigeria, exacted, and exact to-day, an abject obeisance
from their counsellors, which, if demanded by a British
Governor, would secure his prompt recall. No chieftain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
whether he be Mohammedan or Pagan, ever enters the
presence of the native Council Chamber of Lagos without
prostrating himself flat upon the ground and kissing it
three times before receiving permission to sit down. Yet
this paramount chief could not alienate a square yard of
land without the sanction of his advisers.</p>

<p>No British Governor is at present in this position.
In practice, his powers under Crown Colony government
are in the ultimate resort absolute and uncontrolled,
except by question, answer and debate, in the British
House of Commons. When, however, the subject-matter
reaches this stage, the man on the spot has probably
already committed the Government, and the department
is therefore bound to defend him.</p>

<p>Admittedly, somebody must protect the native from
the wiles of unscrupulous white speculators, no less than
from the subtle and treacherous conduct of individual
natives. It is the duty of the Governor, as the responsible
authority of the Crown and trustee of native welfare, to
do this; let him by all means have power to prevent the
alienation of land and to grant occupancy rights, but
under a system of government which will give the natives
themselves that which they possess by native law and
custom—a collective voice in such decisions. It should
not be beyond the wit of man to frame a system of governmental
control over native tribal lands which would
satisfy the great mass of the people, for let it never be
forgotten that Africans in the aggregate are reasonable
and by no means difficult to deal with along lines which
are demonstrably equitable.</p>

</div>

<p>In Portuguese West Africa one sees the best and the
worst treatment of native races. The best for the free
native, the best for the educated coloured man and the
best for the coloured woman. In every other colony—and
in this respect British colonies are becoming the
worst—race prejudice not only prevails but is on the
increase. In the Portuguese colonies there is a pleasing
absence of race prejudice; natives of equal social status
are as freely admitted to Portuguese institutions as white
men; the hotels, the railways, the parks and roads
possess no colour-bar, and if the Portuguese colonies
could be purged of their foul blot of slavery, the natives
of other African colonies might well envy their fellows
in Portuguese Africa. Alongside intimate social relations
with the native is a widespread plantation slavery in
Angola, San Thomé and Principe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANGOLA</div>

<p>Angola, one of the largest political divisions of West
Africa, is bounded on the north by the Congo, the east
by Rhodesia and on the south by German Damaraland;
a considerable section of the northern territory, including
the whole Lunda country, comes within the operations
of the General Act of Berlin. Apart from the Lunda
province and strips of land bordering the rivers, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
colony cannot be said to give any promise of an agricultural
future, although if one nation is adept over all
others in turning wastes into gardens, that nation is the
Portuguese, to whom gardens and plantations are second
nature. A Portuguese house without its shady vinery,
its delicate fernery and luxuriant kitchen garden is unthinkable;
even the little children in the streets, instead
of building castles and grottos, find infinite delight in
laying out miniature gardens, in which they arrange
flowers and ferns with artistic taste.</p>

<p>Economically, however, Angola does not pay, its
finances are like many of its old houses—very unstable
and subject to leakage. Walk its streets, visit its
families, Government departments or merchants’ houses,
and certain it is that every other man you meet will remind
you forcibly of Micawber. The Portuguese community
in any part of Angola can be roughly classed as
the Moneylenders and Borrowers. Each, however, appears
to be supremely happy and lives in absolute assurance
that something will turn up every day to render life
more agreeable.</p>

<p>Loanda, the capital, is a strange admixture of ancient
and modern dwellings, old churches, a roofless theatre
and dilapidated bull-rings. But despite its shortcomings,
the Portuguese have made Loanda the most restful
health-restoring sea-port in West Africa. Boma, the
capital of the Congo, is distant only twenty-four hours’
steam, but it is surely the most unhealthy and the most
foodless place in Africa. The Belgians, if they liked,
might supply fresh provisions to its starving and dying
population,—for everyone in Boma is dying, it is only a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
question of time. In Boma, fowls, eggs, fruit, fish and
vegetables are priceless, while every day shiploads can
be purchased very cheaply in Loanda, and if shipped
twice a week to the Lower Congo, would at least make
life, though short, more comfortable.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus37" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus37.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">LAND FORMATION, LOANDA, PORTUGUESE ANGOLA.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one place every visitor to Loanda should
inspect—the old Dutch Church dedicated to “The Lady
of our Salvation.” Some American dollars would be
well spent in preserving this relic, for it is one of the many
instances which demonstrate that slaving was a pious
occupation in the early seventeenth century. The whole
of the interior was once composed of blue and white
tiles of pictorial design, and one on the north wall of
the chancel is still complete; this apparently represents
the conquest of Angola by the Dutch, who are seen in
broad-brimmed hats, braided coat-tails and parade boots,
fighting and slaughtering the hosts of savages. The
whole operation against the unfortunate infidels is being
directed, and presumably blessed, by the Lady of our
Salvation enthroned in the clouds.</p>

<p>If Portuguese enterprise has made Loanda a restful
spot for weary travellers, British capital—in the person
Robert Williams—has turned an unknown strip of desert
land into a nourishing sea-port now known as Lobito
Bay. It is from this port, with excellent anchorage and
transport facilities, that the West Coast will connect
with the Cape railway. This Lobito—Katanga railway,
though it has only completed some 450 of the 1200 miles
to Katanga, promises commercial success when opened,
for it should then constitute the cheapest transport route
to Rhodesia and the Congo; that is unless the Portuguese,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
with their usual short-sighted economic policy, kill the
enterprise with tariffs before it has had a real chance of
life.</p>

<p>There are only two other ports of any consequence in
Portuguese Angola—Mossamedes and Benguella; the
latter a harbour with perpetual “rollers” which make
a stay on board anything but a comfortable experience.
The town itself, like most Portuguese institutions, is
going to ruin: the only redeeming feature being the
maintenance of its public gardens, fountains and
Eucalyptus avenues. Catumbella, an inland town, lies
midway between Lobito Bay and Benguella, and with
the latter town, constituted the principal centre of the
slave-trade. The old slave-compounds and prison-houses
confront the traveller in every part of Catumbella and
Benguella, and although many have fallen into disuse,
some still have the appearance of occasional occupation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PORTUGUESE “HOTELS”</div>

<p>Loanda, Lobito and Benguella all possess “hotels.”
Those of the capital proper are a strange mixture of
cleanliness, tobacco-ash and half-hidden dirt, but at least
they are free from the presence of those unfortunate
white women who intrude themselves with such persistence
on the attention or inattention of passing white travellers
in Benguella, and live by running accounts paid irregularly
by white men in that most loathsome of all towns in West
Africa. Those wishing to visit Benguella should order
their rooms months ahead and not be surprised if on
arrival Senhor has forgotten all about the order and has
neither room nor bed at his disposal. A sound and
vigorous rating, however, will generally extort a promise
of a room somewhere, a promise which will seldom be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
fulfilled until all other guests have retired to beds severally
robbed of one portion or another to make up an incomplete
set for the newly-arrived guests. Nor must
the tired travellers be surprised if a black boy enters the
bedroom, without knocking, and demands the “other
master’s pillow,” only to be followed later by another
woolly pate thrust round the doorway sleepily requesting
the surrender of a counterpane or towel, for yet “another
master.”</p>

  <p class="caption">CHANCEL AND NORTH WALL OF DISUSED DUTCH CHURCH, LOANDA.
  <a href="#Page_171"><i>See p. 171.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>It is useless to expostulate with the hotel manager,
who will reply with a veritable flood of apologies and
threaten to break the head, and neck if necessary, of
every black boy in the place, and yet the guest knows
with mathematical certainty that he will again have to
go through the same course of torture before getting a
troubled sleep on that straw mattress in yonder whitewashed
room. This is the whole trouble with the Portuguese,
commercially and diplomatically; their eternal
protestations of sincerity, integrity and courtesy on the
one hand, and, on the other, a total incapability of
observing the most sacred promises. It is an old story,
the same which confronted Wellington in the early
nineteenth century. The Portuguese is very like the
African; you despair of curing him of his weaknesses—which
are, after all, seldom intentionally vicious—and
yet you love him, because his kindly nature
compels you.</p>

<p>The chief interest for the British public in Portuguese
colonies arises from two distinct causes—financial interests
and treaty obligations. Our financial interests are not
large; they involve certain railway schemes, the supply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
of labour for the Transvaal mines, and a few plantation
and merchant enterprises. Our treaty obligations,
binding us in definite alliance with Portugal, may at any
moment involve Great Britain in a grave international
situation. The value, or otherwise, of such an alliance
is open to a difference of opinion. It is, however, imperative
that our ally should observe all moral standards
which the civilized Powers are pledged to maintain with
all the forces at their disposal. Travellers, consuls,
merchants, sea captains and government officials have
repeatedly called attention to the prevailing slavery and
slave-trade in Portuguese West Africa; both of which
detestable practices are in gross violation of Anglo-Portuguese
treaties, the Brussels and Berlin Acts. All,
or any, of the civilized Powers can at any moment—and
in point of responsibility should—intervene and demand
the abolition of slavery in Angola, San Thomé and Principe,
and if Portugal continued to beg the question by calling
slavery by some other name, that Power, or those Powers,
could, if they so desired, shake her out of her indifference
by casting the anchor of a battleship in sight of the ports
of San Thomé and St. Paul de Loanda. I am not advocating
such a course for one moment, but it is vital that
the British public should realize that in the event of any
Power signatory to anti-slavery Conventions waking up
for any reason, disinterested or otherwise, to treaty
obligations, and making some effort to discharge those
liabilities, such Power would be at once confronted by the
possibility of Britain’s navy defending Portuguese
colonies, although run by slave labour. A pretty spectacle
indeed, Britain’s matchless fleet defending the slaver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
only wanting old Jack Hawkins on the Bridge, to complete
the picture!</p>

<div class="sidenote">MAINLAND SLAVERY</div>

<p>Portugal shares with every other West African Power
the problem of shortage of labour and with it the short-sighted
energy of the impatient employer, who, beyond
the ken of the official eye, frequently resorts to illegal
means for increasing his supply. Domestic slavery
survives in Portuguese Angola as well as in Nigeria, and
in Belgian and French Congo. One can only estimate
very roughly the slave population of Africa, but probably
not less than a million human beings are to-day ignorant
of the blessings of personal liberty. Mr. Nevinson, in
his admirable book on “Modern Slavery,” says of Angola
alone, “including the very large number of natives who,
by purchase or birth, are the family slaves of the village
chiefs and other fairly prosperous natives, we might
probably reckon at least half the population as living
under some form of slavery.” We cannot acquit many
Powers in Africa from the charge of profiting administratively
from this form of human chattelage, but when
Portugal sets up a <i>tu quoque</i> plea we are compelled to
differ. The dividing line between the Powers is that
whilst many of them profit by this practice occasionally
and for restricted periods, the Portuguese descend to the
lowest level, adopt the native practice themselves and thus
become not the “hirers,” but the owners. In this way
they endeavour to meet their interminable shortage in
the labour supply. To what lengths they are prepared
to carry this system may be gathered from the report of
Professor A. Prister in the <i>Hamburger Fremden-Blatt</i> for
28th July, 1906:—“In Angola, even in San Paolo de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Loanda, under the eyes of the Governor, the Bishop
and the high officials,” he alleges, are to be found
“regular ‘bridewells’ for the production of slaves.”
One of these, he says, he visited on the estate of “one of
the richest Portuguese,” sixteen miles from Loanda.
There he saw a large number of women, with only a few
men, at work. “Each woman has a little hut, in a courtyard
enclosed by a wall, in which she lives with her
young ones. The woman is always pregnant, and
carries her last child on her back, during work, in Kaffir
manner. The overseer of this plantation, who treated
me in every respect with Portuguese friendliness, and
took me for a great admirer of his breeding establishment,
told me that about four hundred negroes were
there, and added with a laugh that he had over a hundred
young ones in the compound. This is just as if a cattle-breeder
were boasting of the fine increase in his herds.
When the young one is so far grown up that he can be
put to some use, at from six to eight years of age, he
enters into a so-called contract, or he steps quite simply
into the place of a dead serviçal. For instance, Joseph
is told that his name is no more Joseph but Charles,
and immediately the dead Charles is replaced. He
never fell ill; he never died; he only lives a second
life.” It is to be hoped that such incidents are rare
even in Angola, but it brings home forcibly to the British
mind the sort of colonies the “matchless navy” of Great
Britain may be called upon one day to defend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTRACT LABOUR AND SLAVERY</div>

<p>Certain apologists of the Portuguese are very fond of
comparing the British indentured labour system with
labour conditions on the Angolan mainland and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
islands. The labour system of the East and West Indies
are by no means ideal, but there is a world of difference,
not only in the daily management of this labour, but
fundamentally.</p>

<p>In San Thomé the contracted labourer from Angola
is a slave: he calls himself a slave, and the Mozambique
free man holds him in contempt as a slave; either he was
captured, or purchased on the mainland with cash by the
plantation owners just as men purchase cattle or capture
wild animals. Every single slave with whom I spoke,
both on the mainland and on the islands, gave me the
clearest account, replete with convincing detail, of the
manner in which he or she had been either kidnapped or
purchased. Not a few of the slaves had “changed
hands” several times before the ultimate sale to the
planter.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Slave’s Case</span></h4>

<p>In the back streets of Angolan ports, on the highways
of Lobito and Benguella, and in the shady by-paths of
Catumbella, the traveller may at any time penetrate the
secrets of the tragedies which attach themselves to the
souls of men and women who have lost their freedom.
The same tragedies but with attendant secrets darker still,
are locked within the breasts of the slaves on the Portuguese
cocoa islands in the Gulf of Guinea. There by the
roadside, on the banks of crystal streams, up in the cocoa
roças, and along the valleys thick with cocoa-trees, the
traveller has abundant opportunities for penetrating the
secrets of the miserable slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VOICE OF THE SLAVE</div>

<p>Behind the mountainous coast of Angola, the town of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Novo Redondo hides itself in a hollow, as if ashamed of
its history, or perhaps so that its traffic in human beings
during past centuries might escape the attention of watchful
cruisers. There, amongst a group of slaves and freemen,
I met a woman with a story more eloquent than others
because it was also so recent, so vivid and so forceful.
She had not been long on the coast, for only a few months
ago she had for the first time witnessed the Atlantic
breakers tossing themselves with their impetuous fury
on that strip of rocky shore. The hour was that of
the mid-day rest, and the woman was sitting sadly apart
from the other labourers. A glance at her attitude,
coiffure and other characteristics rendered her a somewhat
singular figure in that group of serviçaes, still there was
a familiarity which surely could not be mistaken—somewhere
in Central Africa those cicatrized arms, that
braided head, had a tribal home.</p>

<p>“True, white man, I have come from far; from the
land of great rivers and dark forests.”</p>

<p>“How were you enslaved?” I asked.</p>

<p>“They charged me with theft and then sold me to
another tribe, and they in turn to a black trader. This
man drove me for many ‘moons’ along the great road
until a white man at D⸺ bought me and sent me here.”</p>

<p>“Where am I going now? Who can tell? I suppose
I shall be sold to a planter.”</p>

<p>There was no need of the slave’s reiterated assertion
that she had been nearly ten months marching down to the
coast; the locality of her tribe was plainly set forth on
the forearm by the indelible cicatrizing knife of her race.
The journey from the Batetela tribe of the Congo to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
shores of Novo Redondo cannot be much less than 1,500
miles. This was one of the most recent cases we discovered
and shows that the slave trade in Portuguese
territory is a question of the moment.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, it is said, a ragged urchin ran the streets
of San Thomé, holding sometimes for a five <i>reis</i> piece,
sometimes for as many kicks, the heads of mules and
horses for the affluent slave-planters of that island. That
ragged urchin to-day possesses a mansion in three capitals
of Europe, and a stately car rushes to and fro with the
sovereign lord of some thousands of slaves. The sycophants,
time-servers, and others of the crowd of parasitic
admirers, who cluster round this august person, care
little for the misery beneath that sordid splendour. His
wretched slaves spend their days from 5.30 in the morning
until sunset cultivating cocoa, that their master may
fare sumptuously every day in Europe, and finance
dethroned Royalty which is not ashamed to use these
ill-gotten funds in half-hearted endeavours to regain a
discredited crown. The slaves know nothing of this;
one thing only they know is that when the bell rings at
sunrise they must devote their energies to the production
of the cocoa bean until sunset, and that this weary
monotony has in it not a glimmer of hope of cessation.</p>

<p>Along that picturesque road, known as the Mother of
God road (philosophers might give us some reason why the
slavers in all history annex the Holy Virgin), we once
met a group of slaves with a sadness written on their faces
which seemed almost to cry out, “We are lost souls.”</p>

<p>“Are you well fed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, white man, we are fed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“Housed?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you freemen?”</p>

<p>“No, we are only slaves.”</p>

<p>“Would you like your liberty?”</p>

<p>“Aye, would we not, but Master won’t liberate us.”</p>

<p>Amongst that group was one old man quite grey,
who declared he had been on the islands over thirty
years, and his conversation so interested me that I asked
him to describe his journey to the coast. This, though
a story over thirty years old, was full of terrible interest.
The old man had by this time gained some confidence,
and when speaking of the district where he was first sold
I became convinced that his home was in the far hinterland
of the Congo. With unexpected suddenness I startled
him by uttering one of the rhythmic morning greetings
of his native tongue. The old man started at first, as if
struck with a whip, then, like a man half awake, he
appeared to reach after some unseen thing; then at last
it suddenly broke in upon him that the language he had
heard was the music of his boyhood; his wrinkled old
face was wreathed in smiles, his tired eyes lit up, and then
in short animated sentences he poured forth question
after question.</p>

<p>“Oh! white man, tell me about Luebo, tell me about
Basongo.”</p>

<p>“Tell me is Kalamba still alive?”</p>

<p>The impetuosity of the questions, the lively gestures,
the hungering look in those brown eyes showed how the
old man thirsted for information of his little village away
on the banks of the broad Kasai.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>The island of Principe has a horror all its own, for it
is infested with the dread sleeping sickness. Conditions
are so bad that the Portuguese dare not send the free
labourers from Mozambique, lest their current of labour
from that part of West Africa should take alarm and cease.
White men and women are fleeing from danger, but the
authorities still keep slaves within biting distance of the
fever impregnated fly. Dr. Correa Mendes, a courageous
Portuguese medical authority, has urged that every
living animal should be killed as the only hope of saving
Principe; but none have yet dared to propose the liberation
of the slaves.</p>

<p>The slaves of Principe present an even more melancholy
appearance than do those of San Thomé. They appear
to possess an instinctive knowledge that they are confined
in a death-trap, and their appeals for liberation are
piteously violent.</p>

<p>I cannot readily forget a conversation with four
young slaves on Principe. Of these, but two had known
freedom; the others had been born of slave parents.
On the features of one, the traces of sleeping sickness in
an advanced stage were plainly marked, and though still
labouring at his task, it was plain that death had already
marked him for its own.</p>

<p>I asked the usual questions.</p>

<p>“Are you well fed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Senhor.”</p>

<p>“Clothed and housed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Senhor.”</p>

<p>“You are not flogged or beaten?”</p>

<p>“Oh! are we not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“But I am told the planters never beat you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me then, Senhor, how was this deep wound
caused?”</p>

<p>In support of this statement the whole group of slaves
chimed in with exclamations and assertions that they
were constantly flogged and beaten.</p>

<p>“Do you desire your freedom?”</p>

<p>“Senhor, why taunt us? Did you ever know an
African who did not love his home and country?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think there are people in Europe who will
endeavour to emancipate you.”</p>

<p>“Senhor, I fear when you get on yonder ocean, you
will forget the poor slaves of Principe and San Thomé!”</p>

<p>This latter reply was uttered with so desponding a
note that I ventured to make the slaves a promise, which
British honour—no less than British responsibility—should
see fulfilled.</p>

<p>“Listen, I am now going to Europe and shall soon
meet the liberty-loving British people. I know how they
detest slavery; I know how they will struggle for your
liberty. Take this promise yourselves—and pass the
word round the plantations to the other slaves—God
helping us, we will set you free within two years.”</p>

<p>The effect of this promise was good to behold, the
eyes brightened, there was an elasticity in movement
and grateful word of thanks as the slaves resumed their
never-ending task. Even the slave in the fell grip of
sleeping sickness appeared to share in the joy of a freedom
he could not hope to experience.</p>

<p>Not all the slaves are purchased for plantation work,
as the following typical instances will shew. Beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
black women have their price. The day was indeed a
hot one as I strolled along the shores of the Atlantic
below the mouth of the Congo, when a finely-built young
woman met me. Originally captured over 2,000 miles
away, her fine figure and bright features had obtained
for her captor a high price as “domestic” for the white
man. To him it was nothing that she longed to exchange
her captive life for that home away in the far interior,
or that the roar of the waves was a perpetual reminder
of the gentle lappings of the lake shore of Tanganyika.
The woman was his slave, purchased with “honest money”—his
slave until he ceased to want her, and then—well,
he would sell her to the nearest planter and buy another,
for healthy young girls are always marketable not
only in Portuguese territory but in other parts of West
Africa.</p>

<p>Another day two white-clad European travellers
might have been seen moving in and out amongst the
villages outside a Portuguese town of Angola, exchanging
greetings with half-dressed natives. Presently it is
realized that this is no casual visit of curious strangers,
for it is obvious that the white man’s handshake is but
an excuse for a closer scrutiny of the arm, the temple, or
the chest, and the natives gather round the travellers as
they proceed from group to group. Something now
arrests attention, for the white man is sitting down
amidst a party of four or five women.</p>

<p>In a few minutes confidence has been gained, and the
women submit to an examination of certain marks cut
years ago on their arms and foreheads. The white man
first tries a sentence in a tongue unknown to the group<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
of interested onlookers, but there is no response from
those to whom it was addressed. He tries another, and
there is a sudden silence; all eyes are directed to a woman
who, after a faint cry of amazement, is gazing fixedly
into space, for the white man had by that sentence struck
a chord silenced by long years of sorrow and suffering.
The woman gazed on silently and intently as if trying to
recall a half-forgotten past. She travels in thought
back over yonder mountains, across the hot plain, and
on by rippling streams and through valleys thick with
ripe corn, away across the Cuanza river, on for months to
Lake Dilolo, where she sees again as in a vision the white
man who bought her from the native slave-trader. In
fancy she leaves the cornfields of Angola, crosses the upper
Kasai, and is away north beyond Lusambo, and westward
to the little Congo village with its deep green plantain
groves and manioca fields.</p>

<p>A remark breaks the spell, and she realizes that it was
but a dream, for she is still a captive; but the white man
speaking her native tongue is no dream—he is still there
speaking the language that sounds like the far-off music
of another life. The light of hope dawns in her eyes as
she turns on the traveller, pleading, “White man, can’t
you take me home?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PLANTERS’ CASE</div>

<p>It must not be supposed that all the San Thomé
planters on the island believe in, or defend, present conditions,
any more than it must be supposed that, without
exception, they are habitually guilty of inhuman maltreatment
of the slaves. The charge of maintaining slavery
most of them emphatically deny, and in support of their
contention point to legal contracts which cover the original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
transaction by which the labour was obtained. They
also remind the investigator that the labourers are paid.
There are, however, some honest planters who admit
that the original “contract” was not altogether genuine,
and the statements made by the planters and the slaves
respectively with regard to the wages paid, differ so
absurdly that one is compelled to dismiss both.</p>

  <p class="caption">THE END OF THE SLAVE. TWO SLAVES CARRYING DEAD COMRADE
  IN SACK TO BURIAL.</p>
</div>

<p>To many managers definite acts of cruelty would be
highly repulsive. It is furthermore very obvious that
not a few owners and planters do everything which science
and money can provide to make the lot of the slave a
happy one. The planters argue with much warmth and
sincerity of conviction that the labourers are better
housed, fed, and clothed on the plantations than they
would be in their mainland villages. Their melancholy
demeanour and their insistent desire for liberty, the low
birth rate and frightful mortality amongst the slaves is
put down very largely to the gross obstinacy and stupidity
of the enslaved negroes.</p>

<p>If the planters are questioned upon the desire of the
slaves to regain their liberty they reply that this would
be an act of injustice because many of the labourers have
forgotten the districts from which they were originally
“recruited” and that even if complete repatriation
were carried through the men and women repatriated
would probably fall a prey to evil influences on the
mainland.</p>

<p>The attitude assumed by the Portuguese authorities
towards the question of slavery in their West African
colonies has hitherto been first of all one of inferential
denial that slavery exists, and secondly they call attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
to the elaborate regulations framed for protecting the
natives from any infringement of their liberties.</p>

<p>On paper, the labourers are contracted for short
periods of service in Angola and the cocoa islands; are
said to have a happier lot than any other contract labourers
in the world; and that any who so desire are free to return
to their homes at the termination of their contracts. A
great deal more is on paper which, if practices only
accorded with the minimum of professions, would assure
the cessation of slavery in Portuguese West Africa.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing written in the earlier days upon this
question has brought out so forcibly the “ownership”
feature of labour conditions as the disclosures made in
the Cadbury—<i>Standard</i> libel action. In that trial Sir
Edward Carson called attention to a circular forwarded
to Messrs. Cadbury referring to the sale of an estate in
San Thomé. The stock enumerated included one item,
“Two hundred black labourers ... £3555.” This gives
the average price of the slaves as £18 <i>per capita</i>, taking
the sick with the healthy and the young with the old.
Various prices are quoted as the value of the slaves, but
this depends, of course, upon physique, sex and age.
Mr. Joseph Burtt, the Commissioner of the cocoa firms,
gives £25 to £40, whilst Mr. Consul Nightingale stated £50
as the average price. When in Portuguese West Africa
several of the slaves were even able to tell us the prices
at which they were purchased by the different middlemen,
and occasionally even by Portuguese themselves.</p>

<p>The evidence now to hand of the existence of both
the slave-trade and slavery is overwhelming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR EDWARD GREY’S “BEYOND DOUBT”</div>

<p>On November 22nd, 1909, the Portuguese Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Minister called upon Sir Edward Grey, apparently with
the object of discussing this question, and in conversation
the Foreign Minister informed M. Du Bocage that the
information he “had received from private sources placed
<i>beyond doubt</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the fact that it had been the custom for
natives to be captured in the interior by people who were
really slave-dealers; the captured natives were then
brought down to the coast and went to work in the
Portuguese islands.”</p>

<p>On the 26th of October last, Sir Arthur Hardinge,
whose intimate knowledge of slavery questions is probably
unequalled, informed the Portuguese Minister for Foreign
Affairs that when he was in Brussels, he “had heard
serious complaints in official circles at Brussels of the way
in which slaves were kidnapped by Angola caravans from
the Kasai district of the Congo, which shewed that the
charges made did not emanate solely from missionaries
or philanthropic sentimentalists.”</p>

<p>In July, 1909, an exhaustive series of regulations were
issued from Lisbon. The 139 articles covered almost
every actual and conceivable feature of the whole
labour question, but as Mr. Consul Mackie pointedly
remarked—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Angolan native ... is contracted in a
wild state under circumstances of doubtful legality,
and is so convinced that he is a slave that nothing
short of repatriation, which should therefore be
compulsory, would serve to persuade him that, at
least in the eyes of the law, he is a free agent. It
would obviously be useless to argue that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
‘serviçal’ is not a slave merely because he is
provided with a legal contract, renewable at the
option of his employer, in which he is officially
proclaimed to be free.”</p>

</div>

<p>The evidence, therefore, that the Portuguese colonial
labour systems are pure slavery is confirmed (a) In a
British Law Court, (b) by the British Foreign Minister,
(c) by the British Consul on the spot, and (d) by Sir Arthur
Hardinge. Could anyone desire more emphatic evidence
than is now provided? and this does not exhaust the
available sources, for even the Portuguese themselves
have now been forced to admit that the slave-trade is
very much in evidence.</p>

<p>Writing to Sir Arthur Hardinge on October 23rd last,
the Portuguese Foreign Minister admitted that there
was—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slave-traffic with the inhabitants with Luando,
in the district of Lunda.... It was ascertained
that in reality the Bihean natives were in the habit
of settling their debts and disputes by means of
‘serviçaes.’ Two convoys proceeding from Luando
were captured, and the serviçaes handed over to
the delegate of the Curator concerned, to be retained
until claimed by their relatives, to whom
the necessary notice was sent.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is instructive to note that the Portuguese Minister
in this passage makes no distinction between serviçaes
and slaves, yet when unofficial critics declare that in
practice the terms are indistinguishable, they are condemned
for deliberately confusing the public mind. It
is also of importance to bear in mind that the Lunda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Province is included in the territories which come
under the operations of the Berlin Act, whereby every
European Power is under the most solemn responsibility
to secure throughout these territories the abolition of
slavery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PORTUGUESE OFFICIAL ADMISSION</div>

<p>There is further the evidence, from a Portuguese source,
in the fact that in 1911 eleven Portuguese are reported
to have been expelled for engaging in the slave-traffic.
The Governor of Angola informed Mr. Drummond Hay
that nothing severer than the order of expulsion was
administered owing to the lack of “conclusive evidence,”
but four months later the Portuguese Foreign Minister
admitted that the Europeans “by the inquiry were
found guilty of acts of slave-traffic.” Sir Arthur Hardinge
pointed out that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“the 5th article of the Brussels General Act contemplated
severer penalties in the case of persons
engaging in the slave-trade than an order of
expulsion before trial or a prohibition to return
to the colony, which such persons, if convicted of
a serious criminal offence there, would hardly
need.”</p>

</div>

<p>When, therefore, the long stream of unofficial testimony
upon the existence of the slave-trade and slavery in the
Portuguese colonies is confirmed in turn by the British
Minister at Lisbon and by the British Consul of Angola,
and moreover when Sir Edward Grey, who always chooses
language with exceptional care, officially informs civilization
that the charges are proved “beyond doubt,” and
finally when the Portuguese authorities are driven to
admit it, then surely the time has come to cease gathering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
evidence and to set about some substantial and far-reaching
measures of reform.</p>

<p>To meet a situation which is a grave international
scandal and a potential menace to European peace,
what do the Portuguese offer to civilization? They claim
good treatment of the labourers, humane regulations
and repatriation of the slaves.</p>

<p>It is common ground that the slaves upon the islands
are, generally speaking, well fed, housed and fairly well
clothed, but the slaves themselves are emphatic in their
assertions that they are frequently beaten. This the
Portuguese deny, but those who know West Africa are
perfectly well aware that it is impossible to keep something
like 40,000 slaves working on the cocoa farms at the rate
of “a man per hectare” without a considerable amount of
“pressure.”</p>

<p>The regulations are exhaustive upon every feature
of the labourer’s life except emancipation, from the time
he is “recruited” until he is buried, but as Mr. Consul
Mackie has recently pointed out, “The absence of any
(regulations) for the return journey in the event of the
labourer declining to accept the conditions of the contract
is somewhat suspicious.” That the keeping of statistical
records is part of the ordinary administrative routine is
a common-place, but that this elementary duty may be
performed, a regulation was issued three years ago, yet to
this day that instruction has never been carried out, with
the result that no reliable information is possible with
regard to the birth and death rates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MORE REGULATIONS</div>

<p>According to regulations, every labourer’s history is
carefully recorded and the fullest details endorsed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
the contract, yet in the case of 135 out of 163 slaves
repatriated in the early part of last year it was impossible
to state how long they had been upon the islands. This
is not only a further evidence of the futility of Portuguese
regulations, but it constitutes additional evidence as to
the fictitious nature of the supposed “contract systems.”</p>

<p>To the tragedy of slavery on Principe is added the
ever present horror of sleeping sickness which is everywhere
raging on the island. To the lasting disgrace of
the Portuguese Government it still permits the retention
of slaves on the island where conditions are so bad that,
as I have already pointed out, the eminent Dr. Mendes
has advised the killing of all the cattle on the island in
the hope of checking the ravages of the disease. Here
again the Portuguese Government has been content to
meet the situation with paper “regulations,” which
would be comic if it were not for the distressing condition
of these wretched slaves. According to these regulations
all the slaves “must wear trousers to the heel, blouses
with sleeves to the wrist, and high collars ... they
must wear on their backs a black cloth covered with
glue!” It is barely necessary to state that these regulations
are openly disregarded in every particular.</p>

<p>Finally the Portuguese point to their highly-regulated
system of repatriation. Sir Edward Grey and Sir Arthur
Hardinge have emphasized that “one excellent test” of
a desire for reform “will be the rate and method of
repatriation.” Since the year 1888 some 67,614 slaves
are known to have been shipped to San Thomé and
Principe from the Angola mainland, but it is also known
that a good deal of smuggling has been carried on. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
too, there are some slaves born on the islands prior to
the year 1888, and these are claimed as the property of
the planters. At the same time the death rate has been
very high and the birth rate extremely low, with the
result that the estimate of the slave—or according to
the Portuguese the Angola serviçal—population of about
37,000 is probably fairly accurate.</p>

<p>In 1903 a repatriation fund was established with the
object of providing the repatriated slaves with a sum of
money upon their landing again on the mainland, and
there was a further complicated arrangement which could
have no chance of being effectively carried out, whereby
“recontracted” slaves should receive their bonus in
6 per cent. instalments every quarter. This was no
philanthropic contribution, but actually represented a
regular deduction of 50 per cent. from the “wages” of
the slaves and serviçaes, until May, 1911, when the
deduction was raised to two-thirds, leaving the labourer
only one-third, and as most of the slaves appear to die
prematurely, the benefit they receive from their “wages”
is a negligible quantity.</p>

<p>From the year 1903, when this fund was instituted,
until 1907 these deductions from wages were actually
left in the hands of the planters. In December, 1907,
they admitted to holding £100,000—a not inconsiderable
capital fund for working their plantations. In 1908 the
fund was transferred to the Government bank, but in
the autumn of that year it had by some means, yet to
be discovered, shrunk to about £62,000. After about
nine years’ working this fund stands to-day at approximately
£100,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">METHODS OF EMANCIPATION</div>

<p>In Sir Edward Grey’s despatch to Sir Francis Hyde
Villiers of November 3rd, 1910, he pointed out that
public opinion would be favourably impressed with a
“regular and satisfactory” method of repatriation.
During the early part of this year 900 slaves were repatriated
to Angola and 500 more were due to leave at the end
of June. Probably, therefore, it may be safely estimated
that since 1908 something like 2000 will have been
returned to the mainland before the close of this year,
but even so this still leaves something like 35,000 still in
slavery. Though this “rate of repatriation” shews
some improvement, it cannot be regarded as satisfactory
in view of the fact that unless it is materially accelerated,
it will take not less than twenty years to liberate the whole
of the slaves on the two islands.</p>

<p>Turning to the method of repatriation, it is clear that
this is being carried on in the most inhuman and barbarous
manner. When we were at Benguella, the condition of
the repatriated slaves was so distressing that we offered the
Governor a sum of money to provide the miserable creatures
with food and medicine. This His Excellency could not
receive, nor could he allow the Curador to accept it.</p>

<p>The planters, realizing that civilization demands that
“repatriation” should take place, are just now permitting
it, but they are at the same time doing everything in their
power to discredit it. There is some evidence that they
are only liberating the sick and worn out, for of twenty-eight
slaves recently liberated, whose ages were known,
Mr. Consul Drummond Hay tells us their average age was
forty-two years, and their period of labour on the islands
averaged thirty-one years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>The Portuguese journal <i>Reforma</i> in its issue of
August 19th, 1911, exposes in convincing language the
condition and real objects of this so-called repatriation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The greater part of these ‘serviçaes’ were put
on board without being told what their destination
was, and without any money.</p>

<p>“The first batches that came here had some
money—one of them had 150,030 <i>reis</i> (£30)—but
the last lots arrived without any; thus some were
expatriated instead of being repatriated.</p>

<p>“These people did not bring a single penny, and
it was through charity alone that they received
food and shelter. Almost every one of these
unfortunate people, who have done twenty years
of hard labour, arrived in ruined health, and some
of them died shortly after their arrival.</p>

<p>“It is probable that this form of repatriation is
a stratagem which will, on account of the protests
that will be raised against it in this province,
enable the planters to argue that repatriation is
unproductive of any good results, and that the
truth is, as they have said all along, that people
who have once gone to those islands never want to
leave them again, well knowing that they could
not find a better spot in this world.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE “ARRIÈRE PENSÉE”</div>

<p>The Brussels Conference of 1890 foresaw this danger
and made provision for it in Articles 52 and 63. The
latter stipulated that:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slaves liberated under the provisions of the
preceding Article shall, if circumstances permit,
be sent back to the country from whence they came.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
In all cases they shall receive letters of freedom
from the competent authorities and shall be
entitled to their protection and assistance for the
purpose of obtaining means of subsistence.”</p>

</div>

<p>Portugal was signatory with other European Powers
to the Brussels Act.</p>

<p>Further evidence of the inhuman manner in which
the slaves are repatriated appeared in the Portuguese
journal, <i>A Capital</i>, of June last. The writer, Hermano
Neves, reported that an officer on a Portuguese ship
informed him that in one trip there were 269 liberated
serviçaes, that of these unfortunate beings landed at
Benguella only one was given any money; the remainder,
unable to obtain employment and without money to buy
food, were left to starve. “A few days later, there lay
in the outskirts of Benguella, out in the open, no less
than fifty corpses; those who did not or cared not to
resort to theft in order to live had simply died of
starvation.”</p>

<p>How comes it that in spite of endless “regulations,”
almost every line of which boasts humane sentiments,
and of a Government in Portugal which blazes upon the
housetops its devotion to the cause of human freedom,
these deplorable conditions prevail in the West African
colonies? The reason has been advanced without any
equivocation for years, namely:—the Portuguese colonies
are out of control. Portugal may send a shipload of
regulations out of the Tagus every week and the planters
will welcome them—as waste paper. Some of us have
said this for years and have suffered the inevitable abuse,
but with the publication of the recent White Book, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
actually find this contention corroborated by the Portuguese
Government. Senhor Vasconcellos, replying to
Sir Arthur Hardinge’s representations upon the abuses,
admitted that:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Governors whom he had sent out to give
effect to its (the Government’s) instructions had
been to a great extent paralysed by the power of
vested interests.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is, of course, obvious to all those who realize
the inner meaning of the fact that within ten years the
cocoa islands have had something like twenty-five
Governors. An admission of this nature by the responsible
Portuguese Minister goes quite as far, if not farther,
than the most extreme critic of Portuguese colonial
administration.</p>

<p>The existence of slavery and the slave-trade now
corroborated by officials of the first rank in London and
Lisbon, supported by Consuls, and now by the Portuguese
themselves, leaves no longer any need for unofficial
persons to spend further efforts in an endeavour to establish
the fact. Sir Edward Grey’s “beyond doubt” is in
itself sufficient for the great mass of sane men. With
the breakdown of the Portuguese regulations and the
violation of international treaties, coupled with the
Portuguese admission that their colonies are out of hand,
what can be done to set free the slave in San Thomé
and Angola?</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITISH SUBJECTS ENSLAVED</div>

<p>The question is frequently asked what would be done
if the slaves were set free. We are told that to dump
down on the West Coast of Africa 40,000 penniless slaves
originally drawn from homes in the far hinterland, might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
involve great hardship. We all agree, for we now know
that thousands of slaves were obtained for Portuguese
colonies from Belgian Congo, through the help of the
revolted Congo State soldiery—a body of men numbering
according to circumstances, from 1000 to 5000, who only
kept up their rebellion by purchasing slaves with arms
and ammunition from the Portuguese half-castes and
natives. Again, no one can read the thrilling story by
Colonel Colin Harding in “Remotest Barotseland” without
being convinced that the Portuguese obtained many
slaves from British territory. Lake Dilolo, the greatest
of all the slave-markets, is but a comparatively short
march from Rhodesia, and, in view of local conditions, it
is inconceivable that natives of British Rhodesia have not
been drawn into the slave-traders’ toils in that region.
This feature has recently received an emphatic confirmation
from Mr. F. Schindler, a missionary of over twenty
years’ experience in Angola. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have seen thousands of slaves coming from
the Belgian Congo and Rhodesia being taken
westwards by Bihean slave-traders and in some
cases by half-caste Portuguese, and both by their
tribal mark and by their speech I had no difficulty
in recognizing them as belonging to tribes that are
not found in Angola.”</p>

</div>

<p>How many of these slaves were, and are, enslaved on
the mainland, and how many ultimately found their
destination to be the cocoa islands, it is impossible to
say, but we do know that generally it was the hinterland
native which the slave-traders shipped to San Thomé and
Principe. Moreover, some of us have seen these people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
of the Batetela and Kasai tribes on the roads and plantations
of the islands, the cicatrized arms, legs, chests and
backs plainly indicating their origin.</p>

<p>The first essential, therefore, is that of determining the
countries of origin of the slaves on the islands. To whom
can this task be assigned? Obviously not to the planters;
it might be entrusted to a disinterested Portuguese
Commission, but others have responsibilities and vital
interests—Great Britain and Belgium would both possess,
if not the right of membership, certainly the right to
watch proceedings on behalf of any natives whom they
had reason to believe had been obtained originally from
British or Belgian colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE APPEAL FOR LIBERTY</div>

<p>The planter holds that the slaves are happier on the
islands than they could ever be on the mainland; this
interested and <i>ex parte</i> statement cannot obviously be
accepted as final. The native, and the native alone,
should be allowed to determine his, or her, destiny. I
admit it is conceivable that a few slaves, for various
reasons, would elect to stay with their owners, and no
compulsion should be put upon such to leave the islands,
but beyond all question the majority of the 37,000 slaves
have a deep-rooted and a passionate desire to return to
the homes of their birth. When visiting the cocoa islands
in October, 1910, Mr. Consul Drummond Hay sent his
interpreter amongst the slaves to ascertain whether they
desired their liberty, and in his report to Sir Edward Grey
says: “My interpreter went among the Angola ‘serviçaes’
and his inquiries as to whether they wished to be
repatriated were mostly answered in the affirmative.”
This, be it remembered, was said by the slaves on what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
are admittedly the show plantations. Take these slaves
aside and engage them in conversation, and before many
minutes have passed, the appeal will involuntarily burst
forth, “White man, give us our liberty!”</p>

<p>Having ascertained the districts of Central Africa of
those who desire emancipation and a return to their
villages, it should then be the duty of the representatives
of Portugal, Britain and Belgium, to see to it that their
respective subjects are quickly and safely returned.
Much has been made of the difficulties which would
attend any schemes of repatriation, but in many quarters
these difficulties have been purposely exaggerated. Given
an honest desire to repatriate, the task would at once
become simple. Take first the Angola natives. The
Portuguese could, if they chose, send them back in batches
of 50 or 100 for a given district; a body of such dimensions
attaching itself to an up-country caravan, travelling
under official protection and possibly with a small escort,
would present too solid a company to permit of attack.
Moreover, officials, traders and missionaries, might all
be notified of such companies journeying from the coast
and instructed to aid them as far as possible. The
Lobito—Katanga Railway Company would doubtless be
willing to give cheap passes to batches of slaves originally
secured from the different centres through which its line
now passes. It would be distinctly to their interest to
do so, apart from humanitarian considerations.</p>

<p>We now know that providing the Portuguese Government
would set at liberty the slaves originally captured
from the upper reaches of the Kasai, the Belgian Government
is prepared to send ships to San Thomé to carry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
them back to the Congo, transfer them to steamboats
which would take them back to their homes, or at least
within a day or two’s march. This journey could now
be accomplished in less than a month, whereas several
of the slaves obtained from Belgian territory informed
us that their original journey in the chain gang to the
coast had involved a tramp of considerably over one
year. There is reason to believe that not only would
Belgium undertake this task, but she would do so without
requiring any financial return whatever.</p>

<p>The third and probably the smallest section of the
slaves on the islands—British subjects—can assuredly
present no difficulties. Great Britain could with the
greatest of ease collect her slaves at San Thomé and
transfer them to Rhodesia and Barotseland, via the
Cape.</p>

<p>Portugal should be invited to send an international
commission to West Africa, composed principally of
Portuguese, but with a British and Belgian element,
assisted by men experienced in the tribal languages and
cicatrices of the hinterland peoples. This commission to
be empowered to investigate the whole question and to
issue freedom papers to all slaves appealing for liberty.
In view of the advertised hatred in which the present
Portuguese Government professes to hold every form of
servitude, such commission might easily be appointed in
friendly co-operation with the Powers primarily concerned.
If this were done, the Portuguese Government and nation
would at once merit and undoubtedly receive the warm
appreciation and support of the civilized world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GRAVE STATEMENT</div>

<p>If, however, the Portuguese Government, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
admitting their incapacity to control their West African
colonies, refuse the co-operation of friendly Powers and
maintain a system of labour which violates in several
respects international treaty obligations, it is obvious
that, however much Great Britain may regret it, she cannot
continue an Alliance which may at any moment involve
her in a position of the utmost gravity.</p>

<p>It would be idle to overlook the extremely serious
nature of the statement made by Sir Edward Grey in
the House of Commons on April 3rd, 1912. The Foreign
Secretary then declared that the defensive treaty of
alliance between Great Britain and Portugal, though it
had not been confirmed since 1904, was, like all similar,
treaties which, “not being concluded for any specified
term, are in their nature perpetual.”</p>

<p>Thus it would seem that if any one or more Powers
signatory to the anti-slavery clauses of either the Berlin
or Brussels Acts, should awake to their clear rights and
solemn responsibilities and proceed by any show of force
to insist upon the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade
in Portuguese colonies, the maritime and land
forces of Great Britain could under this Alliance be forthwith
summoned to protect these Portuguese colonies
against the “Aggressors.”</p>

<p>There are some things impossible to the strongest of
Ministers, and the Portuguese Government must realize
that the British people, however much they might desire
to do so, cannot allow the continuance of an Alliance
with a Power which by persistent violation of international
obligations exposes not only herself, but her ally, to a
defence of slavery and the slave-trade. Now is the time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
for Portugal to accept the friendly advice and help of
Great Britain, but as Mr. St. Loe Strachey has recently
said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Either the Portuguese must put an end to slave-owning,
slave-trading and slave-raiding in the
colonial possessions which we now guarantee to them,
or else our guarantee must at once and for ever
cease.</i>”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FUTURE OF BELGIAN CONGO</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Belgium for the time being is in the saddle, but for how
long? Will she prove strong enough, wise enough,
great enough to bring order out of the chaotic state of
affairs into which her late ruler plunged the Congo territories?
It would require a bold man to give an unqualified
affirmative to this question. Cover several
thousand miles of that territory, live for months with
the aboriginal tribes, discuss administrative problems
with Congo officials, watch the operations, and listen to
the conversations of the German and Portuguese merchants—and
a permanent Belgian control of the Congo becomes
a matter of considerable doubt.</p>

<p>Belgian Congo, the largest single political division of
Africa—French Sahara alone excepted—possesses land
and climate of distinct features, and, properly administered,
could pour into the European markets raw materials now
demanded by many of our industries. The total area of
the old Congo State was just over 900,000 square miles,
or eight times the size of Great Britain and Ireland.
A considerable proportion of the territory is covered by
a series of gigantic swamps, with ribs of dry land and
ironstone ridges dividing rivers and lakes. The whole of
these low-lying territories are covered with thick forest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
undergrowth, which renders them impenetrable except
along the native tracks. Throughout the Equatorial
regions it would be extremely difficult to discover a single
acre of open country, and in the territory covered by the
Bangalla and its tributaries it is only with difficulty that
even a camping ground can be obtained. Mobeka, the
State Post at the confluence with the main Congo, was
actually built by gangs of forced labourers carrying baskets
of soil in an almost endless stream for a distance of nearly
two miles inland. This post was formerly the head-quarters
of the notorious Lothaire and it remains to-day
a monument to the luxury with which he surrounded
himself; the carved woodwork from Europe, the doors
and windows, and general upholstery are indicative of
the high favour, or fear, in which this gentleman was
held by King Leopold. Northward beyond the Aruwimi
and southward of the Kasai the character of the country
changes considerably. The eternal forests of the Equatorial
regions give place to rolling veldt or open plains.
Instead of swamps and marshes there are hills and valleys,
although, unhappily, neither fertile nor occupied by a
virile or extensive population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ECONOMIC EXHAUSTION</div>

<p>For nearly a quarter of a century the Congo territories
have suffered from uncontrolled exploitation. Twenty-five
years ago the forests were thick with mature Landolphia
rubber vines. This species of rubber is of very
slow growth and probably some thousands of the larger
vines extend over 100 years. Scientifically tapped in the
season, this great vegetable asset would to-day have been
almost unimpaired and the Congo could still have continued
pouring forth 5000 tons of rubber per annum to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Europe. Nothing of the kind was attempted; the stores
of vegetable wealth carefully husbanded by nature for
generations were exposed to ruthless plunder, the mad
scramble for rubber at any cost to humanity and common-sense
denuded the forests. The vine growths of a generation
were hacked to pieces, and even to-day millions of
dead fragments of vine may be seen scattered all over the
hinterland forests. Even the roots were not spared, for
the unhappy natives, driven to desperation by the white
rubber collectors tore up the roots and forced them to
disgorge their stores of latex. Rubber is still to be found,
but in much smaller quantities, in the Aruwimi district
in the north, the Lomame and Lukenya basins in the
east, and also in certain districts in the Lake Leopold
region, but no merchant should to-day enter the Congo
with a view to making money from virgin rubber.</p>

<p>King Leopold knew all along what the Belgian Government
now knows—that the greatest economic asset of the
Congo would have disappeared by the time the Belgians
inherited the colony, and he met the situation by the issue
of two decrees: one instructing all agents and Government
officials to lay down rubber plantations round every
factory, and the other promulgating heavy fines and
penalties for the severance of indigenous rubber vines.
The latter decree was generally treated by whites and
natives alike as an instruction “<i>pour rire</i>”—a fact known
and probably anticipated by King Leopold. The instruction
to lay down rubber plantations happened to meet
to perfection a feature in the system of Congo State
exploitation.</p>

<p>In those early days—from about 1897 to 1904—there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
might be seen at every rubber collecting centre
gangs of men, women and even children, chained or
roped together by the neck, and these were the hostages
which were being held by the “Administration” until
a sufficiency of rubber had been brought in to redeem
them. Generally these hostages were captured from
amongst the old, the sick and afflicted, or even from the
women and children, the object being to force the young
and able-bodied into the forests to gather the rubber
which would “redeem” the father, mother, sister or
child.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHAIN GANG</div>

<p>The question which had hitherto confronted the
officials was that of finding work for the hostages, for the
Royal Rubber Merchant was known to favour every
expedient which would strengthen the faith of the natives
in the dignity of labour. The instructions, therefore, to
lay down rubber plantations exactly met the situation,
and the thousands of hostages throughout the Congo
were forthwith set to the task of clearing forests and
planting rubber. This removed from the wretched
hostages their last hope of prolonged liberty, for it became
doubly advantageous to capture and retain them. The
slightest shortage of rubber was a sufficient pretext for
capturing more hostages and thus provide labour for the
plantations. A perfect equation was in this way maintained—if
less rubber came in from the forests, more
hostages would be laying down this new source of potential
revenue. Tongue cannot tell, neither can pen portray
the miseries involved in the laying down of these plantations,
but the sight of the suffering natives can never
be effaced from memory. The Congo chain gang respected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
neither position, age nor sex, sickness or health; it held
fast alike the old chief, the weakly man, the young girl
and the expectant mother—a terrified mass of humanity
trembling under the dreaded crack of the whips. The
sentry overseers regarded them as the carrion of the
Congo, for their relatives were guilty of the greatest of
all offences, inability to satisfy the impossible demands
for rubber. The infant in terror clung closer to the
mother, as the woman winced under the lash of the whip.
The young wife brought forth her first-born in her captivity
and was left without any attention to battle with her
weakness, or to succumb. To make a recovery was to
resume her work of rubber planting within two or three
days, with the new-born babe tied to her back. Darker
deeds, too, were committed, and some rubber trees of
to-day were literally planted in the blood of victims.</p>

<p>A writer, “Father Castelin,” greatly impressed with
the wisdom of this undertaking, but apparently caring
nothing about its tragedy of human suffering, estimated
from documents placed at his disposal that the “new
source of revenue” which had been bequeathed to the
Belgian nation, provided 13,000,000 rubber trees. This
“new source of revenue” could hardly fail to provide
an annual return of less than two francs a tree, thus
assisting the budget with an asset of more than a million
sterling per annum. This alluring prospect so impressed
the new Belgian Colonial Minister that he added to his
difficult and recently acquired administrative task that
of rubber production on a “business basis.”</p>

<p>When Monsieur Renkin introduced his famous Congo
reform bill, it contained a proposal to extend the existing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
plantations by 50,000 acres. This in itself was a serious
departure from recognized colonial principles in that it
wedded the newly acquired colony, for better or for worse,
to commercial undertakings. The whole enterprise from
beginning to end is beyond question a miserable fiasco.</p>

<p>In our recent travels we have visited large numbers
of these plantations. They are all of them characterized
by neglect, the majority have been abandoned and are
everywhere falling a prey to rapidly growing forest
undergrowth. A considerable proportion of the trees, as
if in protest against the violence which their planting
involved, are now drying up from the roots. In spite of
the millions of rubber trees planted in the Congo, many
of these being more than ten years old, no plantation
rubber has yet been profitably exported, nor is there any
hope entertained by the officials on the spot that plantation
rubber will ever be an economic success.</p>

<p>Inseparably interwoven with the exhaustion of the
economic resources is the exhaustion of the people
themselves and the break up of their social life. Stanley
estimated the whole of the Congo population at something
over 40,000,000. This was, of course, the merest guess,
but probably the Powers at Berlin did commit to the care
of King Leopold not less than half that number, i.e.
20,000,000. To-day the official estimate gives the total
population at something under 8,000,000. It may be
asked whether I should estimate that more than 12,000,000
of people perished under King Leopold’s régime. I can
only reply—certainly not less. The only ascertainable
data upon which an estimate can be based would amply
confirm such a statement. Many towns whose population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
was known almost to a man twenty-five years ago have
disappeared entirely, and there is not one town to-day
but has lost over 75 per cent. of its population within the
last three decades. There is one redeeming feature, viz.,
that since Belgian occupation there is some evidence that
in several districts the appalling death rate and low birth
rate show signs of regaining a more normal standard.
This was the most apparent in the old sleeping sickness
areas, for we noticed that wherever the Belgian reforms
had been most completely applied, there the ravages of
sleeping sickness appeared to be more or less checked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOME BELGIAN BLUNDERS</div>

<p>When Belgium annexed the Congo, she for many
months retained the old Congo State flag; she still retains
the sobriquet “Bula Matadi”; she retained, and still
retains many of the old Congo officials, and finally she
retained her interest in rubber. These indications did
not escape the notice of the natives who are never slow
to detect circumstantial evidence, to say nothing of the
enlightening influence of the old witch doctor! The
consequence is that the natives distrust the new “Bula
Matadi” as much as they did the old one, for to many
of them there is no visible change. Thus Belgium finds
herself in possession of a colossal colony whose economic
resources are exhausted, whose population has been
seriously diminished, and whose native tribes everywhere
mistrust her administration.</p>

<p>The foregoing features present Belgium with a problem
not to be solved easily by the most experienced and powerful
of colonizing Powers. International obligations, too,
cannot but make that task more difficult. The Congo
must still work out its salvation under the guardian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
eye of the fourteen signatories to the Berlin Act. It is
still the duty of each of these Powers to “watch over the
moral and material welfare of the native tribes.” Not
only so, but the Congo colony is further restricted by
separate treaties with all the Great Powers, which together
provide a shoal of difficulties through which it will not
be easy to steer the Administration without disaster.</p>

<p>The Congo territories, however, are not without assets,
which, in the hands of a bold statesman, are capable of
making Central Africa one of the greatest wealth-producing
areas of the Continent.</p>

<p>The first asset is in the riverine system of the Congo.
The main river has five large tributaries, each of which
provides from 500 to 1000 miles of navigable waterway;
the Busira, for example, 200 miles from the mouth gives
no soundings at a depth of 1000 feet. Each of these in
turn possesses numerous smaller, but still navigable
tributaries. Altogether this fluvial system renders water
transport possible for over 10,000 miles, whilst for large
canoes and launches there is more than twice the waterway.
I know of no district, no matter how remote from
the great fluvial highway, which is removed more than
four days’ march from a river bank. In some parts of
the main river the width is considerably over five miles,
and in others it takes a canoe nearly half a day to thread
its way between the network of islands which cover the
river between north and south banks. There is, however,
the outstanding drawback that as a commercial asset the
whole waterway is blocked at the mouth, strictly speaking
ninety miles from the ocean. There the cataract region
begins which has hitherto defied engineering skill.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Between Matadi and Leopoldville, a distance of just over
350 miles, seven such natural impediments prove an
insurmountable barrier to water transport. This distance
is covered by a railway which connects the lower river
with Stanley Pool, the upper river port. The line is
undoubtedly a thing of beauty, but travelling on it is
certainly not a “joy for ever,” climbing up almost
impossible slopes, skirting ravines and lightly circling
mountain ranges—a triumph of engineering skill, whose
construction, it is estimated, cost a life a sleeper. Its 2 ft.
6 in. gauge and its miniature rolling stock are, however,
totally incapable of dealing with the potential transport
of a colony more than half as large as Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONGO RAILWAY</div>

<p>At present transport on the Congo railway is in hopeless
confusion and the merchant is fortunate indeed whose
goods occupy less than a month traversing that 350 miles,
for the bulk of goods require six weeks to reach Leopoldville,
the port of Stanley Pool, from Matadi on the lower
river. When we were at Matadi there was still 1000 tons
awaiting transport, a small task for European and
American freight trains, but an entirely different matter
on a line where we saw a Congo engine with twenty tons
only in her trucks make no less than three attempts up an
ordinary incline. The Congo railway, at present the only
link between the ocean and the Upper Congo, presents
to the Belgian Government a two-fold problem. The
first question is whether it is possible to turn the whole
track into a broad gauge, capable of bearing heavier
rolling stock with reasonable safety—an initial problem
of doubtful solution, and with it the second is coupled.
If this line were practically rebuilt, at immense cost to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
the Belgian Exchequer, what reasonable guarantee has
Belgium that for all time the French Government will
refrain from constructing a railway from the seaboard of
French Congo to Kwamouth on the confluence of the
Kasai with the main Congo? Given such a condition, it
is all over with the Belgian Congo railway. We know
that many patriotic and far-sighted Frenchmen are
seriously considering this proposition. Then, too, the
French are great railway engineers, and I am informed
that the physical conditions of the country through
which such railway would pass are entirely good. If the
French line were built, the Upper Congo would be brought
at least five days nearer Europe for passengers and mails,
while merchandise would probably save three weeks to a
month in reaching its destination.</p>

<p>Even if Belgium provided an unchallengeable connecting
link between the lower and upper reaches of the two
fluvial systems, the Congo river is beset with political
potentialities of no mean order. It remains to-day an
international highway which presumably any five
European Powers may, if they so choose, bring under
the control of a five-Power river board of management.
As an asset the Congo river is gravely depreciated by the
topographical features from Stanley Pool to the mouth
which place the whole Congo colony at the mercy of the
Power which holds French Congo, and thereby the highway
to the ocean.</p>

<p>Given security of control and also of communication,
what economic future, actual and potential, is there for
Belgian Congo?</p>

<div class="sidenote">VEGETABLE ASSETS</div>

<p>That rubber of the indigenous kind exists to-day in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the recesses of the forest is true. This, as I have said,
applies especially to the Aruwimi, Lake Leopold and Kasai
regions, but only in comparatively small quantities. This
indigenous product finds a sale to-day only because of the
high prices which rubber has commanded during recent
years. Many manufacturers are now refusing to touch
native rubber at all, because it is so full of impurities.
There are, indeed, many competent observers who state
that when in a few years’ time the yield of cultivated
rubber, coupled probably with a successful manufacture
of synthetic rubber has forced down the price of the better
qualities, then the common and impure varieties from
West Africa will be driven out of the market altogether.
Of the various classes of rubber, that of the Congo is
probably the worst, consequently the future of the colony
cannot be based on an exploitation of the indigenous
rubber latex.</p>

<p>Ivory has in the past figured largely in the Congo
budgets, but the ruthless exploitation of rubber had its
counterpart in the wanton destruction of elephants in
order to obtain rapidly every tusk of ivory. The old
Congo State agents frequently sent out parties of soldiers
in search of elephants; to these men ivory took a secondary
place to “meat,” naturally, therefore, they cared very
little for the ivory, and the results of these battues were
frequently deplorable. I remember once witnessing one
of these parties return with “meat” from two young
female elephants and in the canoes they had also brought
with them the dead bodies of two baby elephants which
they had deliberately killed.</p>

<p>The two remaining products to-day are gum copal and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
palm oil. In the closing year of the Congo State the
former was certainly exploited <i>en regie</i>, but mainly in
those districts where exhaustion was overtaking the
rubber forests. The latter produce has never formed
any appreciable article of export.</p>

<p>Gum copal is to-day found in almost unlimited quantities
in many parts of the Equatorial Zone and throughout
the towns and villages the traveller meets natives everywhere
engaged in its preparation. The gum taken from
the upper part of the tree and near the surface of the earth
is excellent in quality and much of it would easily command
1s. a lb. in Birmingham or London. The natives,
however, readily accept 2<i>d.</i> per lb. but with any degree
of competition prices would of course rise. Several companies
are buying to-day faster than they can export.</p>

<p>Whilst passing through the towns, we were frequently
assailed with the cry, “White man, won’t you buy our
copal?” I questioned some of the merchants upon the
possibility of an early exhaustion and was informed that
in the Equatorial regions the exudation, if removed,
replaced itself within a single season. My observation
of some hundreds of copal trees in different areas leads
me to regard this as a somewhat optimistic statement.
It is certain that considerable profit can be made from the
purchase and export of this virgin product, for at the
rate now ruling it can be purchased and transported to
Europe at an inclusive cost of about 4<i>d.</i> per pound.</p>

<p>Palm oil exists all over the Congo. In many districts
the palm forests cover several square miles, but whether
it can be produced at a profit is somewhat doubtful.</p>

</div>

<p>There remain, therefore, but two actual virgin products<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
possessing any certainty of a future—copal, and the
fruit of the palm tree; rubber can only be regarded as
an ever decreasing asset.</p>

<p>What, then, are the potential assets?</p>

<div class="sidenote">OTHER ASSETS</div>

<p>In the mineral world there are some possibilities in
gold, diamonds and copper, but all these are somewhat
doubtful assets and contribute but little to the general
welfare of the community which must rest primarily upon
agricultural development.</p>

<p>Almost any tropical product will grow in the Congo,
for the area is so vast that it provides land suited in one
part or another to coffee, cotton, rubber, cocoa, hemp and
corn. The product of the future will not be determined
only by the nature of the land upon which a given article
can be grown, but rather by the one that is most suited
to the native agriculturist.</p>

<p>The real difficulty is that few Belgians seem capable
of thinking anything beyond rubber on the one hand,
and the native as a servile labourer on the other. Colonial
opinion in Belgium and on the Congo itself appears to be
firmly wedded to this restricted view of colonial expansion.
This circumscribed vision can comprehend the serf, the
labourer, or the domestic slave, but the free, industrious
and successful coloured citizen, carving out an economic
future, in which the State can indirectly share, is apparently
beyond the mental horizon of most of those who at
present control the destinies of the Congo tribes. True
statecraft would have placed a halo round Annexation Day,
making it one of great rejoicing throughout the Congo by
declaring that through the action of a generous Administration
rubber collecting by the State would from that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
date cease for all time. But through lack of colonial
imagination this great opportunity for regaining the
confidence of the native tribes was thrown away, and the
Administration rehoisted the old Congo State flag with a
miniature Belgian flag relegated to the corner, at the
same time letting it be known that upon rubber production—the
synonym of horror to the native mind—the
future would depend.</p>

<p>The failure of the rubber cultivation enterprise is complete.
Whatever the man in the street may think, the
Belgian Government knows that Monsieur Renkin’s
scheme for relieving the Belgian Exchequer has utterly
failed. The twenty to thirty millions of <i>productive</i>
rubber trees dangled before the eyes of the Belgian
tax-payer exist only on paper.</p>

<p>Cotton has been proposed, but what possibilities has
cotton cultivation, not only in the Congo but anywhere
in West Africa, where it comes into competition with
cocoa or palm oil? Cotton requires that the worker
should toil under the fierce rays of a tropical sun; it
demands constant attention if it is to be kept free from
weeds and undergrowth, and when the harvest is gathered
the native can never receive the financial reward which
attaches to palm oil and kernels or to cocoa. In a crude
way the West African is a careful mathematician, and
though in his primitive condition he knows nothing about
square yards, acres and compound interest, he can soon
tell what products he can grow most profitably on a
given piece of ground—and cotton is not one of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONGO POSSIBILITIES</div>

<p>If the Belgian colonial authorities could divorce
themselves from rubber and concentrate on cocoa they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
might yet turn the Congo wilderness into a garden. A
few enterprising Belgians have already seen possibilities
in the cocoa bean. Its cultivation is at present undertaken
by the Belgian Government, the Roman Catholic
Missions, and by a few small companies. The principal
area is that of the Mayumbe, a compact territory between
the Belgian Congo and the Portuguese river, the Chiloango;
there are other plantations a thousand miles from
the mouth of the Congo on the banks of the Aruwimi and
also of the main Congo, but these latter are characterized
by such neglect that no one regards them seriously.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a tract of country more
ideally suited to the cultivation of cocoa than that of
Mayumbe. The hills and valleys abound in water-courses,
the soil is good and the climate reminds the traveller very
much of the Gold Coast territories. Some of the plantations
run for miles along winding valleys, but the great
trouble with Mayumbe is that perpetual nightmare—common
to the whole of West Africa—scarcity of labour!</p>

<p>Within three days’ steam of the Congo, the British
colony of the Gold Coast has solved the question of labour,
has started an industry which gives the native producer
a return of over a million and a half sterling per annum,
has provided the European consumer with a great cocoa
area which twenty-five years ago produced little beyond
internecine warfare and jujus, and yet the Belgian Government
has never even given a practical consideration to
this unique example of colonial expansion which could
so easily be applied to the Congo.</p>

<p>Rubber and cotton have but a small future in the
Congo. Sisal, gold and copper have a possibility, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
cocoa, the products of the palm tree, and any other
vegetable oils, give promise of a real future, provided cheap
transport and sound statesmanship are forthcoming.</p>

<p>An oppressive sense of hopelessness affects the traveller
in the Congo as he speeds up and down those mighty
rivers, across the numerous lakes, or tramps through the
silent forests. He sees the possibilities of that land, the
earth he treads gives forth an intoxicating odour of
fertility. The tribes amongst whom he lives and moves
are nature’s children and the little incidents of daily
travel impress him with the fact that, given a chance,
those sturdy bodies and stout limbs could turn Congoland
into a paradise of affluence and luxury. Then, as
he muses on these things and dreams of ideal homes and
villages, and tropical plantations pouring forth exchange
values of oil and cocoa for cotton goods and hardware,
the practical mind, like Newton’s apple, comes down to
earth again and weighs actualities and asks the pertinent
question—“Can Belgium do it?”</p>

<p>The Congo demands large financial aid from the
Mother country. This is a fact which has never been
realized by the ordinary Belgian—and he might object
if he knew. Even the British subject, whose colonial
conception has grown with him from childhood, has very
little idea of the large sums of money which are found
by Great Britain towards aiding her Crown colonies along
the path of progress. Belgium cannot expect to run the
Congo successfully without large drafts from her home
Exchequer; her colony, measuring nearly a million
square miles, will require at the very least a million
pounds sterling per annum for twenty years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Belgium can beyond question find that sum of money,
providing her people are prepared to share the black
man’s burden which their late Sovereign made so heavy.
The difficulty, however, is that King Leopold and his
entourage made such prodigious fortunes that the Belgian
people have always regarded the Congo as a veritable
El Dorado. The Belgian colonial authorities reiterated
again and again, until quite a recent date, that the Congo
would never involve the nation in financial sacrifices.
Couple this impression, so wickedly fostered by politicians
who should have known better, with the fact that the
Belgian has no colonial conception, and the reader will
agree that any statesman will have a difficult task in
persuading the Belgian nation to make large and continuous
grants from the Home Exchequer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITISH COLONIAL CONCEPTION</div>

<p>The British conception rests upon a profound belief
in the old scriptural paradox: “He that loseth his life
will save it.” The Colonial Office in Downing Street
does not, like its sister bureau—the Foreign Office—display
texts of scripture on its ceilings, and the Colonial Secretaries
might not in this material age admit scriptural
guidance in Imperial affairs, but woven into the fibre of
our administration is a basis of Christian philosophy
which, though it admits occasional incidents of a regrettable
nature, yet pursues in the long run the straight
course of sacrificing men and money for backward nations
and countries, quite regardless of consequences. The
cynic will say, “Yes, with the certainty that the goose
well cared for will lay golden eggs.” Certainly, but that
is part of the Divine contract for pursuing that which
is right. This, however, is what few Belgians understand—or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
any other colonial Power for that matter—but it
is part and parcel of colonial statecraft without which
tropical colonies at least can never be a success.</p>

<p>The financial problem, difficult though it may be,
is the easiest of solution. That of finding the men is at
present insoluble. This is, in part at least, due to another
fatal error made by Belgium when she annexed the
Congo—the retention in her service of all the old Congo
officials. They are there to-day, many of them pressing
on to higher positions in the colony. The fact that these
men, trained to oppression by King Leopold and openly
upholding the old Leopoldian conceptions, are still in
high favour does not escape the quick-witted native, and
of course tends to alienate still further the native and
governing communities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LACK OF MEN</div>

<p>There are, however, other dangers arising from this
situation. These “old hands” are educating the juniors,
and in the process are instilling into their young and
inexperienced minds a dissatisfaction with present conditions
and emphasizing to them that the older system
of “teaching the natives the dignity of labour” was
better all round. They are always careful to add “without
atrocities, of course,” but what they cannot see is that
the old Leopoldian system was impossible “without
atrocities.” It will be readily agreed that when the
burden of the Congo begins to make itself felt upon the
Belgian nation these reactionaries—“Men from the
spot,” “Men of long experience”—will find a ready echo
throughout Belgium. Again, as in the financial position
so also in the administrative future of the colony, the call
comes for the really bold statesman, strong enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
break completely with the past and to clean out of the
Congo these <i>soi dísant</i> administrators, who, incapable
of appreciating colonial requirements, should return to
their original employments of running music halls, tram
driving, breaking stones on the highway, ’bus conductors,
waiters, bricklayers, clerks, and so forth.</p>

<p>“How,” I am often asked, “could these men be
replaced?” First, the very fact that such men are no
longer in the service would undoubtedly attract the better
families of Belgium, for it may be remarked that many
of the merchant houses are able to obtain an excellent
type of man. I asked some of them why they did not
enter the Government service, but almost invariably I
received this kind of answer: “What! join a service with
A⸺ in it!” “What! accept a position under B⸺!”
These replies were eloquent and convincing to one who
easily realized how utterly impossible it would be for the
better type of man to associate with “A⸺” and
“B⸺,” their records being so well known in the Congo,
however much they might be covered up at home. Here
again is further evidence of the lack of colonial imagination
amongst the higher officials in Brussels. If Belgium
cannot find—as admittedly she cannot—a sufficiency of
experienced men in Belgium, cannot she find them in
France and England? She can find them, of course, in
both countries, but hesitates to employ other nationalities
for the higher positions, with the result that very few men
are prepared to accept positions with futures “only for
Belgians.”</p>

<p>A Scandinavian captain recently gave me a good
example of the results of this folly. He informed me that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
a friend of his reached Stanley Pool one day with his
ship after an up-river journey of three weeks. Arriving
at “The Pool,” as the upper river port is designated, the
then superintendent of the marine—who, it was openly
stated, knew more about the manufacture of cheap
pickles than stevedoring—instructed him to load up
90 tons of cargo and sail within three hours!</p>

<p>In vain the captain protested that it could not be done
in the time, and the only reply he received was a batch
of natives hurried down to bundle the cargo pell mell on
board; they pitched the cargo into the holds in any order
and the captain heaved up his anchor and got away as
instructed “within three hours,” but the task of sorting
the whole cargo at every little post over that 1000 miles’
run, turned a normal journey of two weeks into one of
over a month. I cannot vouch for this incident, but it
is typically Congolese.</p>

<p>The Congo territories denuded of their stores of virgin
wealth, with no new sources in sight; the people decimated
and disheartened; the Home Government possessing no
Colonial experience, and still worse no Colonial conception;
the local officials still firmly wedded to the old
theories, constitute anything but a happy augury for the
future. That Belgium possesses many men animated
by the loftiest sentiments is beyond question, but mere
sentiment does not meet a situation which requires a
broad outlook, a large experience and real sacrifice both
in men and money.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRODUCTS OF THE OIL PALM</span></h3>

</div>

<p>With the date palm we have been long familiar, the
cocoa-nut palm likewise, and those too which decorate
our ball-rooms, galleries and banqueting halls, we greet
as delightsome friends, but what is the oil palm—the
Eloesis Guineensis of West Africa? It is said that five
thousand years ago its sap was used by the Egyptians for
the purpose of embalming the bodies of their great dead.
To-day by its aid we travel thousands of miles at express
rate; it has been so handled by modern science that it
enters largely into our diet; the merchants in Hamburg
and Liverpool make fortunes out of it; millions of coloured
people live by it, and yet it is barely known to the civilized
community. A fortnight’s fairly pleasant steam from
Liverpool brings the traveller in sight of the high red
clay coast line of Sierra Leone, and there the oil palm
first greets the traveller in all its luxuriant grandeur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPAGATING THE OIL PALM</div>

<p>From Freetown away down the coast as far as San
Paul de Loanda, the traveller is never far from the home
of the oil palm—the most valuable tree of West Africa—probably
the most prolific source of human sustenance
in the world. She greets the traveller everywhere as he
steps ashore; she invites him to the cool shade of her
avenues leading to some hospitable bungalow; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
affords a shelter at intervals along the scorching dusty
track—as welcome as an oasis of the desert; she waves
at him vigorously from the hill-top like some fluttering
banner, or gently nods her graceful plumes in the still
valley; she stands as sentinel on the outskirts of the
native village, or like some giant memorial column on
the plain. All nature strikes the African traveller dumb
with admiration, but above all in entrancing loveliness
the graceful oil palm reigns supreme.</p>

<p>To the parched and weary she is at once meat and
drink and friendly shelter. Her palm cabbage and nut
oil are no less palatable than her foaming fresh-drawn wine,
and if no other home affords, her branches offer a temporary
and not comfortless dwelling. She provides her
guest with oil to lubricate his gun, with fibre to plug his
boat if it springs a leak; her fronds serve as a weapon
to combat the infinite torment of flies, or interlaced as a
basket to carry a meal. To her the native goes for a tool
or a cooking-utensil, a mat or a loin cloth, a basket or a
brush, a fishing net or a rope, a torch or a musical instrument,
a roof or a wall. To him she is a necessity, to the
traveller a luxury, to the merchant a fortune, to the artist
a subject full of charm.</p>

  <p class="caption">AN AVENUE OF OIL PALMS, 10 YEARS’ GROWTH.</p>
</div>

<p>Professor Wyndham Dunstan has stated that the
oil palm “does not occur thickly much beyond 200 miles
from the coast.” Since those words were written we have
learnt that whole forests of the oil palm exist over a
thousand miles from the coast. It thrives throughout
West Africa wherever the atmosphere is sufficiently humid,
but it loves best of all the swampy valleys of Sherboro
Island and Nigeria, the cocoa farms of San Thomé, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Gold Coast and the Congo, which are by it provided with
the necessary protection from the scorching sun and from
the fierce tornadoes which sweep periodically over the
land. In the strictest sense the oil palm has never yet
been an object of cultivation in West Africa, neither is it
in the literal sense self-propagating. The housewife,
separating the fibrous pericarp from the nuts, tosses the
latter aside or scatters the residue on to the rubbish heap
behind the hut, with the inevitable result of an early and
vigorous crop of young palms. In the course of time the
inhabitants of the village, according to African custom,
pick up not only their beds, but also their huts, and walk,
perhaps something less than a mile away, where they
clear another piece of forest land and build up another
village. The old site, thus abandoned to nature, is
quickly covered with vigorous growth, but in the race
for supremacy the graceful palms lead the way and become
the communal property of the former inhabitants.</p>

<p>The screeching grey parrot of West Africa with its
horny bill tears the oily fruit from the bunch, after
consuming most of the oleaginous fibres of the pericarp,
drops the nuts whilst flying, far and wide. These, in
turn, add to Africa’s economic wealth, and thus do man
and animal join in spreading through ever wider regions
the growth of the oil palm.</p>

<p>Within ten years the tree begins to push out its
bunches of fruit, beginning with tiny bunches of the size,
shape and appearance of an ordinary bunch of black
grapes. Some trees bear in eight years, and an earlier
date still is claimed for certain varieties, but the fruit
at this stage seldom yields any appreciable quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
oil. From fifteen onwards to a hundred and twenty
years, the palm plantations give forth an almost continuous
supply of fruit, every tree bearing twice a year. In the
rainy season the supply is most abundant, but in the
second period, known by many as the “short wet”
season there is a fair secondary harvest. All the trees
do not, however, bear at the same time, and in many
areas of the Equatorial regions where the seasons are not
sharply defined or always regular, the supply of nuts is
never exhausted.</p>

<p>In appearance a head of fruit resembles a huge bunch
of grapes with long protecting thorns protruding between
each nut, and a good bunch will contain from 1500 to
2000 nuts. A single fruit in appearance is about the
size of a large date, and the pericarp is composed of fibre
matted closely together with a yellow solidified oil, which
fibrous substance envelops a nut or “stone”; this in
turn encloses a kernel of the size and shape of a large
hazel kernel, in appearance and composition indistinguishable
from the well-known “Brazil nut.” From the fibre
a dark reddish oil is obtained, whilst the kernels that are
shipped to Europe yield a finer white oil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLLECTING THE NUTS</div>

<p>The almost universal practice amongst the natives
in harvesting the nuts is to climb the tree by walking up
the trunk with the aid of a loop of stout creeper.
Arriving at the top at a height of sixty or eighty feet, the
man deals a few vigorous blows with an axe which severs
the bunch or bunches from the tree and they then fall
to the ground. As the whole family usually takes part
in the production of oil and in the division of labour, the
man, having cut down the fruit, descends the tree, picks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
up his protective spear or gun, and returns home, closely
followed by the wife and daughters, who transport the
bunches of nuts in the wicker baskets which they have
woven in their spare moments.</p>

<p>In every colony a similar process is adopted to separate
the fruit from the parent stem. Until it is over ripe,
the fruit not only adheres firmly to its stem but the
porcupine thorns sometimes two inches long, make separation
anything but a pleasant task. The tribes everywhere
collect the clusters or bunches into heaps and
cover them with plantain or banana leaves, exposing them
to the sun for from three to six days, the effect of which
is that the nuts, subjected to the hot rays of a tropical
sun and cut off from the refreshing sustenance of the
mother tree, lose their tenacious grip and readily drop
away from their stem.</p>

<p>The methods adopted to force the oil from the fibrous
pericarp differ considerably in the several political
divisions of West Africa. Roughly, however, they fall
into two divisions: (<i>a</i>) by fermentation; (<i>b</i>) by boiling;
and in certain parts of the Kroo Coast by a combination
of both methods.</p>

<p>The fermenting process is carried out by placing a
large quantity of separated, but hard, nuts into a hole
about four feet deep, this having been first lined with
plantain leaves. In the regions nearer the coast
towns, these pits are either paved or cemented inside
and in some cases they are both paved and cemented.
The nuts are covered up and then left for some weeks,
even months, to ferment thoroughly. They are then
either pounded in the pit with wooden pestles, or they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
may be taken out and treated in prepared wooden
mortars.</p>

<p>The process of boiling is more expeditious. The nuts
are boiled or steamed until the firmly coagulated fibre
shows signs of yielding; then they are placed in an old
canoe or large mortar and pounded with wooden pestles.
In both processes, whether by fermentation or by boiling,
the oily fibre separates itself from the hard inner “stone.”
The fibre, which is by this time a tangled mass of yellow
and brown, is then taken and squeezed, sometimes with
the aid of water, through a woven press and a stream of
golden liquid results. Sometimes loads of the oily fibre
are thrown pell-mell into a large canoe half filled with
water in which the children delight to paddle, causing
the oil to rise to the surface, when the elders skim it from
the top and carry it in earthenware pots for boiling and
straining before sending it on its way to the market and
the European consumer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OIL AND KERNEL TRADE</div>

<p>The oil, however, is but one exportable product of
the palm tree; the value of the inner kernel may be
gathered from the fact that over four million pounds’
worth of palm kernels are sent to Europe every year.
This kernel is encased in an extremely hard shell, which
varies so much in size that until quite recently there was
no satisfactory “stone” cracking machinery in Africa.
There are now several machines on the market, but the
old grey-haired lady of the West African kraal, with
her primitive upper and nether grind stones, still makes
by far the most reliable “cracker.”</p>

<p>At Victoria, in German Cameroons, we saw an
elaborate set of machinery for dealing in turn with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
oily fibrous pericarp of the nut, and later, extracting the
kernel from the inner stone. The latter process was
that of a general crushing, then throwing the entire mass
into a brine bath and so separating the shells from the
kernels, which were then taken out and dried in the sun.
This process, while being infinitely more expeditious,
has the obvious drawback that a large proportion of the
kernels are so bruised and broken that it entails a considerable
wastage of oil.</p>

<p>Whilst the palm provides one of the principal exports
of West Africa for consumption in Europe, its domestic
uses are inseparable from native life. The fruit is used
by the natives in many sections of primitive culinary
art. Pounded with manioca leaves, Indian corn and
red peppers, a savoury pottage is manufactured which is
a universal delight. One of the choicest vegetables in
the African continent is the pearly white head of the
palm, which, in small trees of two years’ growth, weighs
about 1 pound, but in trees of many years’ growth, may
turn the scale at 56 pounds. The substance of this vegetable
differs in appearance and taste but little from the
Brazil nut, but when cooked provides a succulent dish
not unlike, though superior to, sea kale. The natives
cook this in palm oil, but Europeans usually prefer it
boiled and served with a white sauce, or baked in a
custard. To obtain this vegetable is almost invariably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
to destroy the tree, consequently it seldom figures on the
every-day menu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OIL AND WINE</div>

<p>Meat, fish and fowl are all of them stewed in palm
oil, and, as African meat is deficient in fat, the palm
oil makes an excellent and appetizing substitute. I
once smelled a very savoury native “hot pot” which,
upon examination, revealed a wonderful mixture. The
liquid was golden with palm oil, and floating about,
adding to the compendium of flavours, I detected bats
and beetles, a flat fish “cheek by jowl” with a monkey’s
head, caterpillars fitting themselves in with sections of
field rats and parrots—altogether a stew delightful to
the nostrils, at least of the African boys and girls who
squatted around the huge clay cooking pot. The white
man, though he usually has no keen appetite for native
stews or pottage, lunches and dines off “palm oil chop”
with as great a relish as does his Indian confrère upon
“curries.” The “chop” may be fish, flesh or fowl,
but it all goes by the name “palm oil chop,” which has a
happy and almost essential knack in West Africa of hiding
a multitude of “foreign bodies.”</p>

<p>No African meal can be regarded as complete without
the addition of palm oil, and, as a beverage, palm wine is
extensively though moderately consumed. This sparkling
beverage closely resembles in appearance the “stone
ginger” of civilization. The tribes on the Upper Kasai
are probably the greatest consumers of palm wine in
Africa. In those parts of the tropics where quantities
of sugar cane are cultivated, palm wine competes with a
sister product from the cane; the sweet and somewhat
insipid taste of the latter being more palatable to some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
tribes than the sharp flavour of the palm wine. The
Eloeis wine is the sap of the palm tree itself, extracted by
various means, generally by cutting off the male flower-spike
and fixing a calabash to the wound to catch the
juice which is removed every morning. Another method
is to remove the palm cabbage or head; yet another,
to cut down the tree and “dig” a hole in the heart of
the trunk, from which the liquid is then scooped into
a calabash or earthenware pot. Europeans generally
prefer the wine when fresh from the tree, owing to the
fact that after a few hours it begins to ferment and loses
its sweetness.</p>

<p>The oil palms of West Africa are taking an increasing
share in supplying the temporal wants of both the white
and the coloured man. It is safe to say that there is no
tree in the universe capable of providing to so great and
varied an extent, the daily wants of the human organism.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRODUCTION OF RUBBER</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Rubber has been known for the last four hundred years,
but it is only within the last century, or little more, that
it has been put to practical use. Civilization was for
nearly three hundred years content with the historical fact
of Pincon’s Indians of Brazil playing “ball” with crude
lumps of rubber, and then it awoke to the fact that rubber
could be used to erase pencil marks. In our boyhood
Charles Macintosh had established its use as a protective
from rain, but in our manhood the annual demand of
Great Britain alone for rubber has grown to nearly
50,000 tons. We have lived through the sensation of
a “Rubber Boom” which is only now commencing to
exact its toll for the immeasurable folly of the thoughtless
investing public.</p>

<p>The native use of rubber in West Africa as also among
the Brazilian Indians, was first as an aid to merrymaking,
in the form of heads of drum-sticks, and in that capacity
evoked harmonious chords from the goat-skins tightly
stretched over the hollowed forest log. How little these
early Africans dreamed that this simple aid to the charms
of music would one day deluge their Continent in human
blood! There are to-day very few colonies in West
Africa without rubber forests which nature—prodigal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
here as everywhere with her economic gifts—planted
generations ago.</p>

<p>The discovery of the great West African rubber supplies
dates back about thirty years, but it is a remarkable
fact that Stanley in his books on the Founding of
the Congo Free State, laid very little stress upon the
future of rubber in the Congo.</p>

<p>In 1882 Sir Alfred Maloney urged Southern Nigeria
to wake up to the possibilities of rubber, and in 1894 Sir
Gilbert Carter, to whom our Nigeria colony owes so much,
invited a party of Gold Coasters to explore the hinterland
forests with the result that they discovered an abundance
of what appeared to be rubber-bearing plants and trees.
The native community then set about vigorously searching
for rubber with the result that the “Ireh” tree was
discovered, and specimens of its latex forwarded to Kew
in 1895. Although it had been discovered in the Gold
Coast colony ten years earlier the administration in
Nigeria was apparently in ignorance of the fact.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that King Leopold received
the first intimation of the almost fabulous stores of rubber
in the Congo forests between the years 1888 and 1890,
and the alert mind of that astute monarch lost no time
in formulating plans for its exploitation in the Congo
Free State, and what is less generally recognized in the
French Congo also.</p>

<p>Since 1885, when the African product first made its
presence felt in the rubber market, the natives of that
continent have gathered and sent to Europe over 250,000
tons of rubber, the outstanding fact being that all this
latex represents sylvan produce, the replacement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
which is extremely doubtful. Dr. Chevalier is of the
opinion that the natives themselves received for the total
output 500,000,000 francs or approximately 9d. per pound.
This I very much doubt, for it must not be forgotten that
a large proportion of the rubber was obtained, if not for
nothing, then for very little.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WEST AFRICAN VARIETIES</div>

<p>The principal sources of rubber latex are the Funtumia
(Ireh) and the Landolphia varieties, which, to the ordinary
reader, fall respectively under the classification of trees
and vines. The full-grown Funtumia tree measures
from 2 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft., or more, in circumference. The
growth of the Landolphia is wild and erratic, creeping
along the ground sometimes for several yards, then
gradually winding its way through the undergrowth
and away up the limbs and branches of the firmly rooted
forest giants to a height of forty to fifty feet, then in the
full enjoyment of light, it becomes vigorously prolific,
sending its leafy branches in all directions, and interlacing
the trees overhead. Most scientists seem to agree that
it is only when the Landolphia emerges into the sunlight
at the tree tops that material size is imparted to the
main stem. From the economic standpoint it is important
to bear in mind that ordinarily a Landolphia vine
takes from ten to twenty years to climb its way up the
tree trunk of the average forest tree, at which period the
main stem of the vine is seldom more than one inch in
diameter.</p>

<p>Beyond question by far the larger proportions of
rubber from Central Africa have been obtained from the
Landolphia vines, that from the Congo basin almost
entirely so. Next in order comes the output from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Funtumia forests of the more northerly latitudes, and
beyond this a certain amount of grass rubber has been
obtained, but the results barely justify the trouble
involved.</p>

<p>The extraordinary development and almost general
investment in the rubber industry have familiarized the
public with rubber production. Almost every schoolboy
could write an essay upon the herring-bone or half
herring-bone tapping, coolie lines, spacing and so forth.
The production of rubber conveys to most minds well-ordered
estates of upright trees, model workmen’s dwellings,
drying and boiling sheds, constructed by skilled Europeans,
rolling tables, hot and cold water supplies, all under the
control of neatly clad coolies. None of these conditions
apply to West Africa, for there everything is to-day
primitive.</p>

<p>The larger Funtumia trees are tapped in a very rough
“herring-bone” manner and the latex caught either in
leaves or in a calabash, and then transferred to a wooden
receptacle for coagulation, but large numbers of trees
have been bled to death through the almost incessant
tapping to which they have been subjected. Funtumia
more than any other variety requires carefully-regulated
tapping, and it is well-nigh hopeless to expect the native
collector in the hinterland regions to exercise that degree
of care which the Funtumia tree demands as the price
of giving forth a sustained output. The damage done to
the bark alone in the rough and ready methods of extraction
almost invariably renders the tree unfit for future
tapping; the trees will live sometimes for a few years,
but before long they perish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Dr. Chevalier, writing of the Ivory Coast, says:
“Wherever exploitation has spread it has caused the
adult Funtumia trees to disappear very rapidly. Some
are cut level with the ground by the natives in order to
extract their maximum yield, others, tapped too frequently,
die standing, at last there remain only young
Funtumia trees, under fifteen years of age.” This is
true of the major part of the rubber-bearing regions of
West Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHODS OF EXTRACTION</div>

<p>Several methods are followed in the extraction of the
latex from the Landolphia. In every case that has
come under our notice the vines were cut down with little
thought for the future. Indeed in the upper regions of
the Congo the natives sever the vine close to the ground
and then tearing it from the trees to which it clings, they
cut the vines into lengths of about eighteen inches and
pile them into stacks so that from the severed ends the
latex may bleed into forest leaves or gourds. Many of
the tribes raise the stack of severed creepers upon forked
sticks and kindle a slow fire beneath as they assert that
the latex flows more freely and completely with the
application of heat.</p>

<p>The whole process is beyond question most wasteful,
particularly where the natives not only sever the vine,
but dig up the roots, compelling these also to yield up
their stores of latex. To-day as the traveller marches
through the rubber forests of the Congo basin he meets
every few yards little heaps of decaying vine from which
the rubber has been taken. Frequently too, one sees
overhead a tangled mass of dead vine which has withered
away through the main stem having been severed. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
natives were either in too great a hurry, or else unable
to climb for those spreading vines which would often
measure some hundreds of yards.</p>

<p>Another method is that adopted by the native tribes
in the Kasai River of the Congo, and the Lunda province
of Portuguese Angola. Whole families or tribes will
make a temporary home in the forest, pitching their little
huts on a piece of high ground near a stream. Every
day the men will scatter in all directions cutting down and
gathering the vines into bundles which they will convey
to these little encampments.</p>

<p>The bark of the vines is then stripped off and laid out
on blocks of wood, old canoes, boards, or trunks of trees,
preparatory to beating it with heavy wooden mallets,
which process gradually reduces the bark to a stringy
mass not unlike shredded tobacco. It is then threshed
with smaller mallets which in time gradually pulverize
the wood element into fine powder, leaving “pancakes”
of red rubber, about the size of a breakfast plate. These
are then cut into thin strips, starting from the outer
edge, and wound into balls, just as the manufacturers
wind balls of knitting wool. This method though
equally wasteful in collection, conserves the whole of the
rubber latex.</p>

<p>Travellers in the Kasai territories of the Congo are
generally first aware of their approach to human habitation
by hearing the distant thud, thud, of the rubber
mallets which is a feature of almost every village of
that region.</p>

  <p class="caption">EXTRACTING RUBBER, KASAI RIVER, UPPER CONGO.</p>
</div>

<p>Hand in hand with the rubber work of the Congo is
that of cane basket making, which the busy women weave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
in all sizes for packing the rubber, thus avoiding the heavy
cost of importing “shooks” or barrels from Europe.
Every year some hundreds of thousands of these light
but very strong hampers are made for conveying the
rubber to the buying stations and thence to the European
markets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FUTURE</div>

<p>The West African rubber problems of to-day which
overshadow all others are those of exhaustion and
replenishment. Are the forests denuded of rubber, and
if so, is there any probability or possibility, of rubber
cultivation to replace the exhausted supply? Both
these phases of the question are difficult of complete and
categorical answer.</p>

<p>For thirty years now exploitation has been running
wild through the forests, and within the last fifteen
years the rate and methods of exploitation have from
every point of view been ruinous. The Funtumia
trees have been ruthlessly cut down and even where
tapping has taken place, it has been done at any and
every season of the year, and in general practice tapped
whenever and wherever the tree would yield an ounce of
rubber.</p>

<p>Dr. Chevalier is of the opinion that the Funtumia
will replace itself owing to the remarkable habit of self-propagation
which the tree possesses. The light feathery
seeds are easily carried upon every breeze it is true, but
unfortunately there is little hope of preserving these
young trees from crude and reckless tapping in the farther
recesses of the forests. It is generally accepted that the
rubber vine areas are being rapidly exhausted. Mr.
Consul Mackie says of the Congo, “Wild rubber in districts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
in which it has been worked on an extensive scale, is now
becoming scarce in places. Many of the large rubber
zones have been worked out completely.”</p>

<p>We were informed by natives of the Kasai who were
bringing in their rubber to the factories, that whereas
ten years ago they had only to go one or two days into
the forests before finding rubber, they now have to journey
nearly a fortnight before they can locate any appreciable
number of vines. Throughout the Equatorial regions
of the Congo, the rubber vines and trees are so completely
worked out that the natives have given up attempting to
collect rubber and devote all their energies to gum copal
and palm oil.</p>

<p>Most disinterested “coasters” will support Dr.
Christy in the opinion that if the African rubber industry
is to depend upon the wild forests there is very little
chance of its survival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CULTIVATION IN THE CONGO</div>

<p>Within the last fifteen years efforts have been made
in various colonies to cultivate rubber. The most promising
results are certainly in Nigeria, where the Benin
communal plantations are proving so successful that
villages in other districts are commencing similar plantations.
Many thousands of Funtumia trees are now ready
for tapping and some of the rubber obtained has secured
6s. 6d. per pound. Individual native farmers are now
taking up rubber planting, and in Southern Nigeria we
saw some well-ordered plantations under native control,
one of which started in 1896 has over 30,000 trees and
gives promise of a good output. In the Gold Coast the
natives are interspersing Funtumia trees with their cocoa
plants, under the instruction of Government advisers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
In Belgian Congo vigorous efforts have been made for
the last twelve years to cultivate rubber. In the year
1899 a Royal decree was issued requiring that 150 trees
or vines should be planted for every ton of rubber
exported, and in June, 1902, the number of plants was
raised to 500. As a further incentive some of the Concessionnaire
Companies gave a bonus to their agents for
every tree planted. The ordinary Belgian being very
keen on piling up his banking account the planting was
pursued with vigour. As, however, the ordinance did
not specify the variety to be planted the Agents of the
State and Concessionaire Companies planted varieties
good and bad, known and unknown! until on paper
the total number of trees planted ran into many
millions.</p>

<p>Every few months an Inspector was supposed to visit
these areas, but as this official usually had an area of
about 25,000 square miles under his control, he was seldom
able to visit more than one centre every year. Badly
paid, with little allowance for provisions, this man usually
responded to the warm hospitality of his planter host,
and generally did not make exhaustive inquiries into the
rubber planting. On one occasion such an inspector
visited a district after the Agent had gone to Europe,
in order to “check” the trees and vines before the
new Agent arrived to take over the stock and plantations.
He asked me if I could direct him to one plantation of
60,000 trees and vines of which he possessed a neatly
drawn chart. I could only direct him to where the
plantation was supposed to exist, and he immediately
set off on what I hinted was a useless journey, and as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
expected returned in the afternoon without having
discovered a single vine!</p>

<p>Apart from these paper plantations there are certainly
several millions of rubber trees in the Congo, and every
species almost has been tried. At one time the Belgian
tax-payer was told that the Manihot Glaziovii was going
to provide fabulous returns, but when the floods came
and the winds blew, the spreading Manihots caught the
force of the elements and toppled over in all directions
like ninepins. The Funtumia was then going to save
the Congo from financial disaster, but the “borers” took
a fancy to the tree and this, coupled with the fact that
in the Congo the Funtumia yields but little rubber, all
serious attempts at the extension of Funtumia have
been abandoned.</p>

<p>Hopes are now being centred upon the Hevea
Braziliensis, but though many of these trees are of ten
years’ growth the yield is equally disappointing.</p>

<p>In German Cameroons rubber planting is being pushed
forward mainly with the Funtumia and Hevea varieties.
In Portuguese West Africa hopes are centred upon
Manihot and Funtumia.</p>

<p>The best that can be said of the rubber cultivation in
West Africa is that it has not yet passed the experimental
stage, and that there is some promise of success
in the Gold Coast and Southern Nigeria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUBBER COMPETITION</div>

<p>There is, however, one other factor which must not
be overlooked, Mr. Herbert Wright pointed out last year
that cultivated plantation rubber would soon be arriving
in quantities which would cause embarrassment to the
rubber merchants. It is certain that when this happens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
prices are bound to fall, perhaps dramatically. The
question for the West African rubber planting community
to ask is: can they, when prices fall, compete
with the West and East Indies, where labour is plentiful
and cheap, and where there is practically no costly land
transport. A merchant from the Straits Settlements
once informed me that West African rubber producers
must be prepared to compete with the East—at 9d. per
pound. If that prediction should be justified by future
events then West Africa will be wise to concentrate upon
its trusty friends the Oil Palm and Cocoa Tree.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRODUCTION OF COCOA</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Cocoa to most individuals is suggestive of carefully and
tastefully packed tins, or in chocolate form, of delightful
little packages done up in neat silver paper and prettily
tied with bows of silk ribbon. To others it means a
welcome and fragrant breakfast or supper beverage.
To few, indeed, does it represent anything else. The
man in the street, if he thinks at all upon investing his
savings in cocoa, argues that after all there is a limit to
human digestion, particularly where sweetmeats are
concerned, consequently he need not trouble himself
about “futures” in cocoa for the field is at best a restricted
one. It never occurs to him that the demand for
every species of vegetable oil and fat is becoming more
clamant every day. Somehow he never asks himself
why Bournville, York and Bristol cocoa is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
pound, and Dutch only 1<i>s.</i> per pound. He presumes,
and if he tries it he knows, that one quality is better than
the other, but it does not occur to him that there is
something in the one beverage which is lacking in the
other. The butter from the latter—the pure fat too
expensive to eat, but not too expensive to incorporate
in pomades for personal adornment, has been extracted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
There is no more rigid limit to the demand for cocoa
than to the demand for rubber; not only so, but nothing
has yet appeared even on the horizon of our imagination
that can take the place occupied to-day by the cocoa
bean, both for internal and external consumption. This
cannot be said with regard to rubber, wool or silk.</p>

  <p class="caption">COCOA ON SAN THOMÉ. TERMITE TRACK VISIBLE ON THE
  TRUNK OF THE TREE.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">COCOA IN CULTIVATION</div>

<p>The total world’s supply is to-day close on a quarter
of a million tons of cocoa per annum. The East and West
Indies and the great Amazonian Valleys, have for generations
poured their supplies into Europe, but it is only within
the last thirty years that West Africa has made her
influence felt upon the cocoa markets of Europe. It is
very difficult to obtain reliable evidence as to the colonists
who first introduced cocoa to West Africa, probably the
credit for it belongs to the Portuguese, whose love of
colonization is everywhere evinced by the plants, fruits
and grain which they conveyed in past years from one
continent to another.</p>

<p>Given a humid atmosphere, a well-watered land and a
tropical sun, cocoa will grow almost anywhere up to a
height of nearly 1500 feet. Of such lands enjoying
atmospheric conditions highly suitable to the production
of cocoa, there are nearly one million square miles in the
tropical regions of the West African continent. San
Thomé and Principe, with less than 300 square miles
under cultivation, supply to the world’s markets over
30,000 tons of cocoa every year; if, therefore, but one
quarter of the potential cocoa producing areas of West
Africa could be brought under cultivation at the same
rate, there could be produced over 25,000,000 tons of
cocoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>To-day cocoa is being cultivated in the German
colonies of Togoland and Cameroons; in the Portuguese
colonies of Cabenda, San Thomé and Principe; in the
Belgian Congo; in the Spanish island of Fernando Po,
and in the British colonies of the Gold Coast and Nigeria.
In all these the production has distinctive features.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of plantation arrangements and
the application of scientific methods, the Portuguese in
San Thomé are easily first. This no doubt is due to the
fact that for over twenty years the planters have been
concentrating all their efforts upon the cocoa bean.
Throughout their whole area San Thomé and the sister
island of Principe are under cocoa cultivation and the
traveller never gets away from the sour odour of fermenting
cocoa. A series of high hills and deep valleys with
numerous rivulets represent the physical features of the
islands. The hill ranges, for the most part, rise tier above
tier, until they culminate in the Pico da San Thomé with
an altitude of just over 7000 feet. The summit of the
peak is seldom seen, for the island lies bathed in mists,
which warmed by a tropical sun provide the ideal cocoa-growing
climate.</p>

<p>The streams which flow unceasingly down the hillsides
are scientifically trenched so that a continuous
supply of water traverses the cocoa groves all over the
islands, and the farms in the centre of each group of
plantations all enjoy a plentiful supply of excellent
water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PORTUGUESE COCOA</div>

<p>The fermenting sheds are all of them organized in an
up-to-date manner for which a knowledge of industries
in other Portuguese colonies hardly prepares the traveller.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
Nowhere throughout West Africa are there such scientific
and elaborate cocoa drying grounds as one sees on these
Portuguese islands. The majority of cocoa planters in
West Africa are satisfied with cemented drying grounds
in open courtyards. The cocoa is spread out to dry and
left in the open not only during the whole day, but
throughout the night. On several roças on the cocoa
islands, the Portuguese have, at enormous expense,
fitted up drying grounds which are mechanically moved
into shelter whenever a storm threatens. Doubtless it
is due to the great care exercised by the Portuguese in
the work of fermenting and drying that their cocoa is so
uniformly good.</p>

<p>Altogether there are nearly 300 roças on the two
islands and, with one or two exceptions, they are in Portuguese
hands; there is a Belgian plantation, and one or two
are owned by natives whose ability to make cocoa production
a financial success is demonstrated by the
fact that one who died recently left £6000 for the education
of the children of San Thomé.</p>

<p>The cocoa plantations on these islands are all so compact
and within such easy reach of the sea-shore that
transport is quite easy. Both horses and mules live
fairly well on the islands, and these, coupled with bullock
carts and some 1500 kilometres of Decauville railway
throughout the islands and running out to the pier, render
unnecessary the porterage which constitutes such a
problem for the cocoa planters in every other colony in
West Africa. It is a melancholy thought that this
industry, built up at so great cost to human life—both
white and coloured—stands only a bare chance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
permanence. The lack of indigenous labour, coupled
with the absence of statesmanship on the part of
the Home Government, can only lead to irretrievable
disaster.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to the Portuguese systems of
cocoa production is to be found in Belgian Congo, where
physical and climatic conditions are almost identical
with those of the Portuguese islands. The first plantations
are met with close to the mouth of the river in the
Mayumbe country, but before reaching the next one has
to traverse nearly a thousand miles. These are situated
at the confluence of the Aruwimi river and the main Congo,
and there are besides several small plantations on the
Aruwimi itself. As cocoa-producing enterprises, the
only ones to take into serious consideration are those of
the Mayumbe country, south of the Chiloanga—the
Portuguese river, which enters the sea at Landana. The
plantations are run under three separate interests, and
may be classified as State controlled, Roman Catholic
and Merchant. The merchants complain that their
difficulty in obtaining labour is greatly increased owing to
the missions and the State using forced labour for their
plantations. It seems incredible that this should be so,
but these complaints are neither new nor isolated. The
Commission of Enquiry sent to the Congo by King Leopold
had evidence before it which shewed that the Mission
farms at least were largely staffed with forced labour.
The following passage is an extract from the report of
that Commission in 1905:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The greater part of the natives which people
the chapel farms are neither orphans nor workmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
engaged by contract. They are demanded of
the Chiefs, who dare not refuse; and only force,
more or less disguised, enables then to be retained.”</p>

</div>

<p>If the Belgian Government could concentrate upon a
serious development of the Mayumbe country by laying
down railways, making roads, building bridges, opening
up creeks, and rivers, there is no reason why the Mayumbe
country should not increase its yearly output of cocoa
by many thousands of tons.</p>

<p>The Spanish contribution to the world’s supply is not
yet or ever likely to be anything material, for as colonists
in Africa the Spaniards have ceased to count.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN COCOA</div>

<p>In German colonies cocoa growing is extending
rapidly and from a financial point of view satisfactorily.
The German Administration in the Cameroons, however,
seems to favour such enterprises mainly as European
undertakings in which the natives are mere labourers.
Within recent years, probably in view of the success of
the Gold Coast production, some effort has been made
to encourage the natives by gifts of seed and young
plants to lay down their own plantations. But the
prevailing German opinion has been set forth in a German
report, published in <i>Der Tropenpflanzer</i> (No. 1, January,
1912), wherein it is stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What is required in the Cameroons is a more
liberal policy on the part of the German Government
towards the plantations, both as regards the
terms for acquiring land, and on the part of the
district officials to obtain better facilities for
getting labour, in order to warrant and make
possible a large and profitable extension of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
cocoa-planting area. This will mean a material
improvement in the prosperity of the colony, for
it is evident that what the Gold Coast has achieved
by means of an intelligent population, and under
suitable climatic conditions, can and will never
be done in Cameroons with such material as the
Bakwiris, Dualas, etc.”</p>

</div>

<p>Whilst colonial Germans take this view, the native
certainly will never emulate the Gold Coast tribes, for the
African has a habit of acting up, or down, to European
expectations. The Editor of <i>Tropical Life</i> truly remarked
that whilst these views are held in Berlin, “Germany
would never do any good with the Bakwiris and Dualas;
neither did she with the Herreros, and so ‘punished’
them because they, poor wretches, could not understand
the German method of ruling Africa as do the
German Michels at home.”</p>

<p>There is some reason to believe that the cultivation
of the cocoa bean began in Cameroons and Victoria some
years earlier than that on the Gold Coast, and it is even
claimed by some that the phenomenally successful industry
of the British colony was commenced with a seed pod
obtained from Ambas Bay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ROMANCE IN COCOA</div>

<p>There is probably no single feature in colonial enterprise
which can compare with the cocoa romance of the British
colony of the Gold Coast. The honour of having introduced
the industry into that colony is eagerly debated.
Everyone agrees that it belongs to either the Basel
Mission through their introduction of West Indian
Christians, or to a certain native carpenter returning
from Ambas Bay, or Victoria. Mr. Tudhope, the Director<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
of Agriculture, is inclined to give credit to the native, but
it must be admitted that the Basel Mission authorities
possess the most circumstantial evidence in support of
their claim. One of their oldest missionaries at Christiansborg
states that about the year 1885 he saw the original
cocoa tree at Odumase; another, that he saw this tree
in full bearing in 1895. It is instructive to recall that the
first export, amounting to 80 lbs. weight, was in the year
1891—that is six years after the original tree was seen
at Odumase.</p>

<p>The missionaries, however, readily admit that soon
after their agents introduced cocoa at Odumase, a native
arrived from, the Cameroon colony and planted beans
at Mampong. From these two centres, fifteen miles apart,
the industry has established itself in every district of the
colony and penetrated ten days’ march beyond Kumasi.</p>

<p>The organization is of the simplest kind—purely and
solely a native industry, few of the plantations being
large ones, none more than about twenty-five to thirty
acres and the majority not more than two to five
acres. We saw none owned by white men, although
I believe there are one or two, which are, however,
quite insignificant. The volume of cocoa which pours
out from the Gold Coast colony flows almost exclusively
from countless small holdings spread all over the
hinterland. The farms are not so close together as
those of San Thomé, but the traveller cannot walk many
miles anywhere without passing through the plantations
of cocoa and palm trees.</p>

<p>The atmospheric conditions resemble the Mayumbe
country and San Thomé, the rainfall varying between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
32.09 and 54.92 per annum, otherwise the territory is
not so well watered as the Belgian and Portuguese possessions.
In spite of this, the colony can produce a quantity
and quality of cocoa that compares well with other areas.
When at the Botanical Gardens of Aburi, we saw a plot
of cocoa measuring one and two-fifths acres with 259
trees planted fifteen feet apart. The yield from this plot
between October 23rd and December 31st, 1909, was
18,200 pods. Mr. Anderson, reporting upon this experimental
plantation says, “Such results will not often be
exceeded in any cocoa-growing country.”</p>

<p>In the year 1891, we almost see that Gold Coast
native offering for sale the first harvest of cocoa. It is
only 80 lbs. in weight and with the greatest ease he carries
it to the white man’s store. To the amazement of his
native friends the grower received £4 for that basket of
cocoa!</p>

<p>Twenty years later the export of 80 lbs. weight has
grown to nearly 90 millions. Since the day that the native
husbandman disposed of his 80 lbs. of cocoa, the industry
has never wavered. We were informed by white men
who have been long on the coast that when the natives
realized the value of cocoa there was an impetuous and
overwhelming demand for seed until competition became
so keen that a sovereign a bean was the general rate!</p>

<p>In 1902 the export had exceeded £100,000; in 1907
it had passed half-a-million, and in 1911 leaving gold in
the rear of competition for first place it raced away beyond
the finger post of a million and a half sterling. The
whole of this, be it remembered, is a native industry!</p>

<p>The Gold Coast natives are justly proud of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
extensive enterprise and assert that they will not cease
extending their plantations until every acre they can
cultivate and every man they can use is producing cocoa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COCOA CARRIER</div>

<p>Not the least interesting spectacle in the Gold Coast
is the transport of cocoa, the bulk of the inland produce
being carried by porters to the railhead, and sometimes
the roadways as far as the eye can penetrate are one long
line of cocoa bags on the heads of hundreds of carriers.
This carrying trade has produced an extraordinary flow
of free labour into the whole hinterland of the Gold Coast.
At Adawso, a buying station nearly fifteen miles from the
railhead, one firm alone employs in the season over 3000
carriers who cover the distance to the rail station of Pakro
once, frequently twice, a day with a bag of cocoa. The
remuneration being according to the quantity carried,
there is an eagerness to earn the maximum within the
twelve hours of daylight. The men who leave by daybreak
will return about three o’clock in the afternoon,
often to pick up another load and carry it to the railhead,
returning again by moonlight.</p>

<p>The carriers are mostly Hausas, but the fame of the
Gold Coast carrier traffic has spread far into the northern
regions of Africa with the result that recognized caravan
routes now come right down through the northern
territories. These carriers, many of them from around
and even beyond Lake Chad, drive herds of cattle down
to the Gold Coast colony about harvest time. They sell
the cattle and then carry cocoa for the season. When the
main harvest is over and there is little cocoa carrying,
they will purchase loads of kola nuts which they carry
back with them to the far interior and sell <i>en route</i> at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
considerable profit. Thus they make a threefold financial
return—on the sale of cattle, cocoa carrying, and profits
on the kola nut trade.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus56" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus56.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">COCOA DRYING IN SUN.</p>
</div>

<p>The transport of cocoa is chiefly in the hands of
alien labour, and should the flow of this labour cease from
any cause whatever, the cocoa industry would suffer a
check from which it would take years to recover. The
coastal regions are fairly secure, for most of the districts
within twenty miles of the coast are reached by a daily
service of motor lorries under the management of the
European cocoa-buying firms. Many of the native farmers
within thirty miles of Accra, however, with true African
trading instinct prefer selling their cocoa at a higher
price at the port of embarkation, and so have created the
interesting system of “barrel rolling.” In the season
these strongly bound and ponderous casks are purchased
from the European stores, filled with cocoa,
and rolled to the sea-shore. Travelling along the
somewhat primitive Gold Coast roads one meets at
frequent intervals perspiring natives struggling with
the barrels which, filled with cocoa, weigh considerably
over half-a-ton. They may be “holding on” to a barrel
racing down a steep incline, or three of them straining
their utmost to force the ponderous weight up a steep
hill. Occasionally they come to grief, for we saw more
than one cask which had fallen over a cliff into a deep
gorge below. Generally speaking, three men will undertake
to roll two barrels to the coast, the three concentrating
their efforts upon a single barrel going uphill, while on the
level road or down hill they control the two barrels
between them. We met three such men who had rolled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
two casks for twenty-five to thirty miles, a task of two
days, for which they receive 20<i>s.</i> per cask.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSPORT DIFFICULTIES</div>

<p>The problem which faces administrator, merchant and
native producer is that of transport. This threatens to
become acute, for we were informed by a merchant who
recently journeyed beyond Kumasi that large consignments
of cocoa were lost owing to the lack of transport
facilities. At the same time, given a fair price for cocoa
in the home market, just treatment for transport labourers,
the extension of roads and light railways, there is no
reason why a single ton of cocoa should fail to reach
the coast.</p>

<p>In the Gold Coast colony the white man occupies his
normal position in the tropics—the connecting link or
middle-man between the European manufacturer and the
native producer. The Government very wisely endeavours
to keep the industry in the hands of the native farmers
and assists them by sending lecturers through the colony,
whose duty it is to advise the farmers upon pruning,
fermentation, drying, the danger of pests, and the general
principles of modern agricultural science. With inherent
instinct, the British Government recognizes that the real
asset of the colony is the indigenous inhabitant, whose
material and moral progress is not only the first, but the
truest interest of the State.</p>

<p>The other British colony in which cocoa has a future
is Southern Nigeria. To read the Government reports
of ten years ago there seemed little hope that the natives
of this colony would become cocoa farmers, or indeed
that they would ever do much more than vegetate in the
agricultural world. Africa is the land of surprises, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
more and more the African is surprising Europe by
exploding “the lazy nigger theory.”</p>

<p>The Acting Secretary of Southern Nigeria, writing
his 1903 report from Old Calabar, said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With every year that passes, it becomes increasingly
important that new exports, indicating
new areas of work and development, should make
an appearance on the export lists of the Protectorate.
That ‘Palm Oil’ and ‘Palm Kernels’
will ever cease to be the dominant products is more
than unlikely; but these products demand nothing
from the native in the way of labour that the
veriest bushman cannot carry out. Portions of
this Protectorate must be gradually turned over—and
education may succeed, where persuasion
fails—to the production of other commodities. It
is not in the nature of the average West African
to lay out capital for which there is no immediate
return. He can understand the yam growing at
his door; he can understand the cask of oil to be
filled before his ‘boys’ can return with the required
cloth, pipe, or frock-coat, but he will not sow for
his son to reap; nor will a village work, of its own
initiative, for the benefit of the next generation
that is to occupy it. It is this difficulty that has
rendered so great the task of encouraging the
rubber industry. It is for this reason that cocoa
and coffee have never been properly taken up by
the natives themselves.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is just what the Belgian and German Governments
are proclaiming to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DOUBLING THE OUTPUT</div>

<p>At this period cocoa was just beginning to grip the
native mind in Southern Nigeria; he had begun to “sow
for his son to reap”; he had begun to understand something
more “than the yam growing at his door”; he had
in fact just dispatched 300,000 lbs. of cocoa to Europe.
The very next year the Acting Governor was able to write:
“There has been an enormous development in cocoa,”
and the Southern Nigeria natives, as if in unconscious
protest against the Governor’s 1903 report, poured into
the European markets over 1,000,000 lbs. of cocoa beans!
Two years later, the export had risen to 1,500,000 lbs.
Turning to the Government report three years later
again, we find that the export had again doubled itself,
and was then over 3,000,000 lbs. “These figures,”
said the Colonial Secretary, “indicate the extraordinary
expansion that has taken place of late years in
the cultivation of this plant.” Finally, turning to the
most recent report, we find that the export has again
doubled itself in two years, <i>i.e.</i> over 6,000,000 lbs.</p>

<p>The actual figures are as follows:—</p>

    <td>(approximately)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It is somewhat doubtful whether this ratio of doubling
the output every two years will be sustained, for it is considerably
in excess even of the Gold Coast rates of increase.
There are advantages possessed by Southern Nigeria
which natural conditions deny to the Gold Coast—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
heavy surf, and the lack of good shipping accommodation,
tell heavily against the merchants and the native
producers of the Gold Coast, whereas it is possible to load
and unload cargoes in Lagos without their suffering any
damage from sea water. Again, the cocoa areas of Southern
Nigeria enjoy in the main a more generous water supply
than those of the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>The general statistics of the cocoa trade, compiled
upon the materialistic basis of tons and sovereigns, are
not without interest to the man outside the cocoa community.
For example, the Portuguese at present produce
more cocoa on their two little islands of San Thomé and
Principe than any other cocoa-producing area in the
world. They produce from those 400 square miles of
volcanic rocky land more than twice the quantity produced
by the Republic of Venezuela with a tropical region of
nearly 400,000 square miles. At the same time out of
the eighteen cocoa-consuming countries of the world the
Portuguese are proportionately the smallest consumers
of Linnæus’ “Food of the Gods.” Another interesting
feature is the growth of the British export from the West
African colonies. Within ten years this has multiplied
itself something like twelve times over, <i>i.e.</i> in round
figures from about 2500 tons in 1902 to over 30,000
tons to-day.</p>

<p>Cocoa grows apparently with greater ease in West
Africa than in any other cocoa-producing area in the world.
The elaborate systems of manuring which seem imperative
in most tropical colonies never enter the head of the West
African producer. He piles the fermenting husks in heaps
between the rows of trees and then when thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
decayed he throws the refuse round the base of the
trees.</p>

<p>Insect pests abound, in fact it is seldom one sees a
cocoa tree free from the tunnels of the devouring termite,
and the bark-boring beetle too makes his presence
felt, particularly in the German Cameroons, but in the
great cocoa-producing colonies of the Gold Coast and
San Thomé, the natives and the Portuguese are profound
believers in the principle of “live and let live,” at least
in favour of the insect world. The Germans, in all things
scientific, have attempted to deal with the pest-ridden
area by manuring with superphosphate and potassium
chloride, and a largely increased yield is claimed for areas
treated in this manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPACING</div>

<p>In very few plantations that we visited was there any
adherence to the wide spacing so strongly advised by
expert agriculturists. The British Botanical Gardens of
Aburi set an example by laying out experimental plots
with cocoa trees fifteen feet apart, but the natives in
that colony, and also in Southern Nigeria, ridicule this
advice and declare that at such distance they find the
rays of the sun are able to penetrate so freely that the
ground becomes baked and the roots are robbed of the
humidity which is vital to the growth of good cocoa
trees. It is noteworthy that on Grenada and other West
Indian estates, there is also a tendency to plant more
closely than the experts advise. Neither in the Gold
Coast nor in Southern Nigeria do many plantations give
wider spacing than eight feet apart, and thus many of
them crowd from 500 to 700 trees upon a single acre.
The plantations in British West Africa being entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
under native control, there are no very reliable statistics
upon the annual yield per tree. One official at the
Botanical Gardens of Aburi estimated that the natives
obtain about 7 lbs. of cocoa per tree per annum; this is
a very high average, and I am inclined to think seldom
attained, for in Trinidad the annual yield is somewhere
about 1 lb. per tree. We visited one large cocoa plantation
in Southern Nigeria, where a native had planted
100,000 cocoa trees about one-half of which were already
yielding, and from the 50,000 he had obtained within
the year 30 tons of cocoa, or an average per tree of a little
over 1¼ lbs.</p>

<p>The most important question, that from which the
planter is never free, is that of labour. The Germans
put the labourers on contracts of twelve months with
wages of 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> per month with food, but the conditions
of these plantations are not likely to inspire any
great enthusiasm amongst humanitarians or economists.
The abject fear exhibited by the natives whenever the
white man approaches is too eloquent to be mistaken,
moreover the whip is carried by the planters as openly
as a man in Europe carries a walking-stick. Whips and
free contracts seldom go together. Under another
section I have dealt with Portuguese labour which in the
main is a system of slavery, although it carries with it a
paper wage of about 10<i>s.</i> per month and rations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COST OF LABOUR</div>

<p>The native farmers of Southern Nigeria and the
Gold Coast employ a good deal of native labour and generally
speaking find little difficulty in obtaining all they
want. These native farmers, however, prepare their
contracts somewhat differently from the European,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
generally they are for “twelve months of thirty working
days,” and the wages vary from 15<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> per month,
whilst a foreman will get 30<i>s.</i> a month. The labourers
are free to go at any time, but those who complete their
contracts to the satisfaction of the employer are usually
given a bonus.</p>

<p>Cocoa growing is probably the least arduous labour
in the tropical world of agriculture, as it involves less
exposure and at no stage can it be called dangerous
as is the case with copra, palm oil and indigenous rubber.
The proportion of labourers employed varies according
to the colony and circumstances. In the island of
Fernando Po, the planters endeavour to employ one man
per acre, but the restricted supply of labour seldom
permits so ideal a proportion. In the Portuguese island
of San Thomé, one labourer is allowed for each hectare
under cultivation, but it must require a good deal of
“persuasion” to get a native to control an average of
at least 2¼ acres of cocoa.</p>

<p>Concurrently with native labour is the question of
white supervision which is necessarily costly. On one
cocoa plantation of San Thomé, with a total expenditure
of £23,000 no less than £3000 is spent upon white control.
Upon those Belgian plantations of Mayumbe which are
cultivated by free labour, there is barely any white
supervision, whilst on the Portuguese islands the proportion
of employés works out at about one white man
to every thirty natives.</p>

<p>So far as it is possible at the moment to forecast the
future of cocoa production in West Africa, the British
system alone rests upon a solid basis, for the obvious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
reason that all other fields are dependent upon systems
of labour supply which have little chance of continuance,
much less extension. The indigenous industry of the
British colonies working in its own interests, unencumbered
by the heavy cost of European supervision
and the drawbacks of imported contract labour, will,
under the guidance of a paternal and sympathetic administration,
certainly outdistance and leave far behind in
the race for supremacy such systems as those which
prevail in San Thomé and Principe.</p>

<p>This virile British enterprise which is bounding
forward throughout the Gold Coast and Southern Nigeria
has only one real enemy—the concessionnaire hunter.
Fortunately, the British Government is fully alive to the
danger and is determined, so far as possible, to keep the
agricultural land in the hands of the natives. If this
can be secured without placing powers in the hands of
the Government which would lead to widespread disaffection
and unrest amongst the natives, then the cocoa
industry of British West Africa promises to eclipse all
other cocoa-producing areas of the world.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The day has gone by when the world could dismiss
Christian missions in West Africa with a contemptuous
sneer, for Christian missionary effort with its eloquent
facts, definitely established, can no longer be ignored.
Of all the forces which have made for real progress in
West Africa, Christianity stands some say first, others
second, but none can place it last. To it belongs primarily
in point of time at least, the economic prosperity of the
Gold Coast. To it belongs, almost entirely, the credit
for the native clerks and educated men on the coast.
To it the natives owe their knowledge of useful crafts.
To one section of the Christian Church at least belongs
the honour of having on the spot saved the Congo natives
from extirpation.</p>

<p>Whilst all missions have much in common, the investigator
cannot but observe the fact that administrators
and commercial men alike will, in the majority of
cases, hold in a measure of contempt the Protestant
missionary, whilst they esteem highly his Catholic
brethren. One searches for a reason for this attitude,
which can neither be found in the devotion of the
missionary—for heroes abound in both sections—nor is
it to be found in the character and success of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
respective missionary labours, for in this particular both
sections are witnessing encouraging results. The only
answer which the administrator and trader will give is
that Father O’Donnell is “a good fellow.” It is difficult
to escape from the conclusion that the good father is
more “diplomatic” than his bluff and somewhat puritanical
Protestant <i>confrère</i>. The Protestant missionaries
with greater freedom than that allowed to the
Catholic Fathers, criticize administrations, report abuses,
and generally give any form of oppression or iniquity
a quick, even reckless exposure. The colossal crime of
the Congo was exposed on the spot almost entirely by
the Protestant missionaries, although far outnumbered
by the Catholics. In the French Congo are established
several Roman Catholic Orders, yet hardly a priest has
raised his voice against the atrocities committed there.
The slavery of Angola and San Thomé has been exposed
primarily by Protestants, the priests standing by and for
the most part content to witness the traffic in human
beings without a protest. I do not condemn, but merely
state facts. I know too well how the sufferings of native
tribes have appealed to generous members of the Roman
Catholic Church, but no review of Christian missions in
West Africa would be honest or complete without some
reference to this fundamental difference between the two
great sections of the Christian Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISSIONARIES AND ABUSES.</div>

<p>My chief reason, however, for calling attention to
this feature is that the antipathy towards Christian
missionaries is hardly likely to become less marked in
the near future. The great changes which are taking
place may precipitate a grave situation within the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
twenty years. The attitude of administrators is no
longer the benevolent tutelage of native races. There
is an increasing autocracy in most colonies; the martial
spirit with its harsh regulations and rigorous discipline,
so out of place in nature’s calm paradise, is permeating
every department of affairs. This spirit brooks no
opposition, knows no sympathy, and sometimes even
forgets justice. It blows hot or cold, where and when
it listeth, but it tends always towards menacing native
peace and progress. High-minded Christian men must
be driven by this restless spirit into an increasingly
resolute defence of their native communities.</p>

<p>Commercial methods, too, are undergoing a still more
far-reaching change. As I have already pointed out,
the old-time merchant is giving place to the highly
organized syndicate, which possesses neither heart nor
conscience and is generally strong enough in influence
at home and power abroad to menace any administration,
and, if necessary, threaten the various Governments in
two, three and even more countries at one time. The
missionary, bold in his isolation, knowing no higher
earthly authority than his highly tempered conscience,
willing, if need be, to suffer any extremity, is bound to
find himself more and more in conflict with the exploiting
energy of these vigorous dividend seekers. This conflict
is of course an excellent tonic for the Church, but it makes
the lot of these isolated men and women in Central
Africa very much harder to bear.</p>

<p>The forces of Christianity have not yet made much
headway in the far hinterland of the Sierra Leone Protectorate,
the northern territories of the Gold Coast,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
nor in Northern Nigeria. In the Sierra Leone colony,
where slaves liberated during a period of fifty years were
dumped down as they were released by British battleships,
Christianity has permeated fairly completely the life
and habits of the people; nearly two-thirds of the population
are nominally Christian, whilst the Mohammedans
number less than one-tenth. In the Gold Coast the
traveller may witness some of the most effective missionary
work in West Africa. The Basel Mission alone
has over 30,000 adherents who find about £5000 a year
towards mission expenses. Another notable fact is that
the natives have invested in the Mission Savings Bank
over £23,000, a sum considerably in excess of the amount
deposited with the Government. As was the attitude
towards the Quaker bankers of Puritan England, the
Christian community of the Gold Coast is regarded by
the natives as the safest repository for the wealth of both
worlds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIANITY AND MOHAMEDANISM</div>

<p>In Southern Nigeria Christian missionaries find themselves
confronted with a firmly entrenched Mohammedan
community. Something over fifty per cent. of the population
is Mohammedan, and that of a most attractive
order. None can meet the leading Mohammedans of
that colony without being impressed with their simple
piety and their tenacity to what they regard as their
invincible faith. Officialdom opposes the advance of the
emissaries of Christianity in the more northerly territory,
on the ground of trouble with the Moslem community.
This attitude is regarded by most Mohammedans as
anything but a compliment to their religious faith,
holding firmly as they do that the Koran is powerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
enough to withstand all the assaults of another creed.
Below Nigeria, that is south-east of the Niger delta,
Mohammedan influence is left behind, and Christianity
is confronted with simple paganism. Not the bloodthirsty
and strongly entrenched barbaric paganism which
confronted Livingstone in East Africa, Ramseyer at
Kumasi, Hannington in Uganda, and Grenfell in the
Congo, but a paganism so broken by the forces of
civilization, so rent and riven by internal mistrust,
that the masses of the people are crying out: “Who
will show us any good?”</p>

<p>Efforts to win West Central Africa to Christianity
divide themselves into two periods. The first effective
efforts were made by the Portuguese and Dutch settlers
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The first
period was almost exclusively due to Roman Catholic
zeal, which, under the blessing of the Pope, regarded the
tropics as a preserve of the Vatican. The nineteenth
century witnessed but little advance, until Livingstone’s
enthusiasm and his romantic career lighted a flame
which spread throughout the civilized world, and Protestantism,
awaking to its opportunity, began to pour
missionaries into the tropical regions of West Africa.
The Basel Mission attempted the Gold Coast, and its
first missionaries perished to a man; the Church Missionary
Society pushed on its work from Sierra Leone
away up the Niger, where men and women did little more
for a time than replace the dead and dying; the Methodists,
never behind any other denomination in enthusiasm,
began work in Sierra Leone, Calabar, and the islands of
the Gulf of Guinea; the Baptists established an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
mission in the Cameroons, where they were “elbowed
out” by the Germans, and at a later date commenced
their great work in the Congo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RELIC WORSHIP</div>

<p>Little remains in the social life of Africa as a result
of the work of the early Roman Catholic missionaries.
The tribes have no settled church organization based
upon the devoted efforts of three centuries ago. Ruins
may be seen in several parts and extremely interesting
ones too. On the islands of San Thomé and Principe,
we frequently saw the partial structure of churches, one
of which must have been erected very early in the sixteenth
century, for a tomb close to the chancel, grey
with age and moss grown, was dated 1542. If the
colonists of San Thomé were zealous slavers, they certainly
gave much of their ill-gotten gain to the erection
of churches. Fragments of these edifices are lying about
in the tropical undergrowth and an examination will
show that marble pillars, façades, altars, even common
stone, had been gathered from the four corners of the
earth to build ornate “Houses of God” on these isolated
rocks in the Gulf of Guinea. Visiting one of these ruins
we were struck by the pathetic reverence with which
the natives regarded those crumbling walls; the priest
had long since died, and there was none to lead those
almost hopeless souls along the path of religious faith.
Standing inside those four walls, gazing at the broken
altar and the creeper-clad walls, we were forced to keep
our heads covered, for the ruin had lost its roof generations
before, and the equatorial sun was pouring its
direct rays upon us. Directing a question to some of
the natives standing near by, we were amazed to find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
that they refused to answer; two or three times we
repeated our questions, but they all maintained immovable
positions and refused to utter a single word. A
man close at my elbow then informed me that no native
could reply whilst the white man kept his hat on his
head in the House of God! The silent rebuke of those
simple natives forced us to leave the precincts of the old
ruin and pass into the little chapel which still remains
more or less watertight. Into this place, not more than
ten feet square, the natives had moved the images of the
Virgin and Apostles, and in the centre of the room a
native palm oil lamp sent forth its unpleasant odour.
This lamp was half African fetish and half salvation to
those natives, for their worship had degenerated into a
sort of corrupt Zoroastrianism, and the Alpha and Omega
of their religion seemed to be the uninterrupted burning
of this light. They were most insistent that since the
foundation of the church, between 1500 and 1530, the
light had never been allowed to go out!</p>

<p>This, however, was but one testimony to the relic
worship of the slave islands. Along the roadsides, in
secluded corners of out of the way roças, nestling in
plantain groves, the traveller may see miniature chapels
constructed from rustic forest tree branches, very similar
to the fetish houses of the mainland of Africa. In most
of these one also sees little prayer-stools, and in all of them
a rude cross roughly cut out with the native axe and the
cross pieces bound together with forest vines. Most of
these crosses are surrounded by native pagan charms,
and thus all that is least essential in Christianity is
joined together in native religious fervour with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
superstitions of paganism, and this gives a melancholy
impression of the result of the years of toil and sacrifice
by men and women devoted to the theory of the Christian
Faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ICHABOD</div>

<p>Ichabod is written along every roadside and in every
ruined chapel; the very images in decay seem to utter
the word, and the mind is compelled to recall the fact
that Christianity in creed only, without Christian practice,
is foredoomed. Surely the curse of the miserable slaves
of generations ago rests upon everything on those islands;
by their agony and bloody sweat they toiled to erect
those magnificent churches, the crack of the whip on
the slave plantations extorted the gold which purchased
the images of the Virgin, to add lustre to countless
churches and to purchase images of the compassionate
Christ for the cross roads and public places. One wonders
what all this parade meant to the slaves at the time.
They have long ceased to suffer the bonds of slavery, or
the crack of the whip; those slaves whose toil built the
churches and bought the crucifixes have gone, and though
decay everywhere marks the one-time existence of an
unholy Christianity, one element remains and flourishes—a
slavery, without any hope beyond that which may
be inspired by the hybrid of effete Christianity wedded
to African superstition.</p>

  <p class="caption">RUIN OF ONCE IMPOSING CHURCH ON THE ISLAND OF PRINCIPE.</p>
</div>

<p>The results accruing to the second period of Christian
propaganda have the unmistakable signs of a vitality
which will revolutionize Central Africa. Whilst purely
missionary zeal centres itself upon the heroic figure
of Livingstone, recognition must be given to Henry
Stanley, and also—though one hesitates to couple the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
name with these two heroes—to King Leopold. Looking
back upon African history, one fact emerges above all
others, that the work of Livingstone and Stanley together
had created an international interest in the position of
the peoples and the possibilities of the countries in those
regions. This condition observed by King Leopold, his
master mind promptly seized and exploited it. The
crafty Belgian monarch saw that by preaching Christianity
and civilization for the African, his long-awaited
opportunity for colonial expansion and a place in history
would be gratified,—a place in history he has that none
assuredly will envy; his people, too, possess a colony,
and though they do not see it to-day, they will yet heap
their curses upon the sovereign who has fastened the
millstone round their necks.</p>

<p>The labours of Livingstone, Stanley, and King
Leopold, culminated in the Conference of Berlin, which
was unique in that it had for its programme not only the
interests of honest commercial expansion, the suppression
of the slave-trade, the sale of arms, ammunition and
alcohol, but also that of stimulating Christian missionary
propaganda, and by its subsequent treaty, missionaries
were encouraged to win pagan tribes from barbarism.
The immensity of the area which by this historic event
was thrown open under international stimulus to the
forces of Christianity is not generally realized. The Congo
basin extends far beyond the boundaries of the Belgian
colony. Its northern frontier reaches the tributaries of
the Niger and the Nile, while its eastern border includes
a large section of German East Africa, and in the south
and west larger areas still of both British Central Africa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
and Portuguese Angola come under the operations of
the Act of Berlin. In and around this great pagan area,
almost as large as the European continent, the forces
of Christianity have within the last half century been
concentrating their energies.</p>

<p>Christian effort in these regions is confined to no
single country, and is the monopoly of no single denomination.
Great Britain, America, Germany, Sweden, and
France have all found devoted men and women, and have
all poured forth most generously the necessary funds.
Anglicans, Roman Catholics, Free Churchmen, and
Lutherans, have all taken their share, selecting spheres
which for various reasons they considered themselves best
able to manage.</p>

<p>The character of the work, however, differs considerably.
At first Protestant missions revolted against the
idea of industrial missions; they had, and it must be
admitted they still have, a constitutional objection against
anything which provides a “return.” It is difficult to
find a reason for this, but probably it is due to a revulsion
from the practices of Pizarro and his miscreants in Peru,
and of the slave-dealing work of the Portuguese, in which
the Church of Rome became so deeply involved. This
dislike for any other work than that of simple preaching
and teaching left to the Roman Catholics the whole field
of industrial enterprise and right splendidly they have
occupied it. There are many separate features which
one dislikes, but looked upon as a complete work
the Roman Catholic missionaries are rendering noble
service to stable progress. I shall not readily forget
visits to their farms on the Congo; to their admirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
outfitting, printing, house-building, and wheelwright
departments of German Togoland. In Lome we saw
a score of lads learning bootmaking under the
patient tuition of a lay brother. In the tailoring shop
another score were cutting out and making suits of
every description, from the cheap 20-mark ducks to
the 150-mark dress suit to which the superintending
Father was putting finishing touches—and made for a
native too!</p>

<p>If in earlier years Protestant missions hesitated to
engage in remunerative industrial pursuits, they scored
heavily over their Catholic <i>confrères</i>, and continue to
score, in medical work. It was at first difficult to make
the native see the advisability of even comparative
cleanliness, for ablutions of any kind are, with many
natives, a degrading practice only fitted for the effeminate
white race. “What! I wash?” exclaimed an old chief
to us in horror-stricken tones, when once I asked him
to take a journey to the river before sitting near our
table. However, as he proceeded to do a worse thing—scrape
himself—I withdrew and apologized for the insulting
suggestion! There is some hope that the medical
fraternity will in time bring the natives to realize the
value of the bountiful streams which God has given them,
though they may retort that the devil has filled them
with crocodiles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MEDICAL MISSION</div>

<p>It is, however, certain that the tribes of Africa are
beginning to value the generous and devoted medical
work of the Protestant missionaries. Journeying up the
Congo one day we had on board a chieftain who three
months before had left his village for an operation at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
mission station hundreds of miles below his home. The
senior missionary in this man’s district had persuaded
him to take the journey and run the risk. The man had
been bedridden for years with an elephantiasis growth;
his wives had forsaken him and most of his friends had
abandoned him. He had long given an obstinate refusal
to the missionary’s proposal, but ultimately he was prevailed
upon to make the journey to the distant mission
post. The day for departure came, and with it funeral-loving
friends, and weeping women who made the track
echo with a monotonous death wail as the man was
carried on board the steamer,—never, as they believed,
to return alive. Two months later the man had come
through the operation and seemed to be in perfect health.
He boarded the steamer in full vigour, carrying his own
box and sundry goods which the travelling native collects
from the long-lost brothers and cousins whom they have
a habit of discovering in every town. After three weeks’
steam, we were nearing the chieftain’s home; what a
dressing of the hair and anointing of the body took place
during several hours before the village itself was sighted!
Within hail, lusty voices shouted to the villagers that
their chief was aboard and was well and strong. The
cry passed from lip to lip until the beach was lined with
incredulous natives, the most hopeful amongst them
anticipating nothing better than that the man would be
carried ashore. Fifteen minutes later the ship was at
anchor, the “gangway” run ashore and lo! the first
man to stride off the ship was the erstwhile bedridden
chief! It was too much for the majority who promptly
took to their heels and bolted to a safe distance! In a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
few minutes, however, they realized that it was not a
spirit, but the real man returned alive and well. Gradually
they surrounded him, questioned him, gesticulated
excitedly, rang the drums to inform the countryside
that so great a miracle had taken place, and generally
made such a din and noise that it was only with difficulty
conversation became at all possible. That sort of sermon
is far more eloquent to the native than many discourses
on Christian ethics preached with the inevitable limitations
of a foreign tongue and at the best often misunderstood;
moreover, it renders him very receptive to
Christian teaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISSIONARIES AND OPPRESSION</div>

<p>The advantage of medical work in Protestant missionary
propaganda has indeed been great. But it does
not stand alone, for the natives have of recent years
witnessed and wondered at another spectacle—to them
no less miraculous—white man opposing white man on
their behalf. It is a grave misfortune to Christianity,
and to the Roman Catholic missionaries themselves, that
they have hitherto been unable to make common cause
with their Protestant brethren in protecting natives
from oppression. There is, however, some hope that
this feature is passing away and that the future will
witness their co-operation with those who fight and
struggle for native freedom, for at present the <i>prestige</i>
which accrues to the championship of native rights
belongs almost exclusively to the Protestant communities.
How powerfully this has operated was brought out in the
report of the Commissioners, whom King Leopold was compelled
to send to the Congo, in 1904. Writing in this connection,
Monsieur Janssens and his Committee said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Often, also, in the regions where evangelical
stations are established, the native, instead of
going to the magistrate, his natural protector,
adopts the habit, when he thinks he has a
grievance against an agent or an Executive officer,
to confide in the missionary. The latter listens
to him, helps him according to his means, and
makes himself the echo of all the complaints of a
region. Hence the astounding influence which the
missionaries possess in some parts of the territory.
It exercises itself not only among the natives
within the purview of their religious propaganda,
but over all the villages whose troubles they have
listened to. The missionary becomes, for the
native of the region, the only representative of
equity and justice; he adds to the ascendency
acquired from his religious zeal the <i>prestige</i> which,
in the interest of the State itself, should be invested
in the magistrates.”</p>

</div>

<p>Without doubt the advent of the late King Leopold
as an Administrator in Central African affairs was a
calamity almost impossible to exaggerate and had his
influence continued it would sooner or later have overrun
the surrounding territories administered respectively by
Britain, France, and Germany. That they indeed suffered
contamination was only too clearly demonstrated in the
case of French Congo, while German Cameroons was not
altogether free from the Leopoldian taint. On the Congo
itself, the very name of white man was made to stink in
the nostrils of the native tribes for all time, by reason of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
the enormities in which King Leopold figured as the chief
actor. But even that wily monarch outwitted himself;
by his protestations of Christianity and Philanthropy he
was bound by the clauses of the Berlin and Brussels Acts
to countenance and encourage missionary enterprise, and
in practice to admit to the vast regions of the Congo
Valley the Heralds of the Cross. And this was his undoing,
for thereby came those exposures of almost incredible
abuses, which shocked the civilized world, and
branded the arch culprit for all time as a murderer of
millions. The same fatal blunder in his diplomacy
worked on the spot salvation for the remnant of the
people. They flocked from all quarters to the protection
of the missionary, who was to them the personification
of justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “INGLEZA”</div>

<p>What wonder that the word “Ingleza” (English)
became a passport to any native community, no matter
how wild and how averse to the white man. It is recorded
that the Belgian rubber merchants, recognizing
this, have sought safety when travelling amongst hostile
tribes in adopting the name and manner of the Englishman.
A certain Belgian tells how two of his colleagues
when travelling were attacked by infuriated natives
whose relatives had suffered at the hands of the rubber-mongers,
and on being told that it was the natives’ intention
to first mutilate them, as they themselves had
been mutilated, and then to put them to death, one of
them in his extremity sought refuge in the reputation
of the missionary and replied, “What, put Ingleza to
death!” While stoutly repudiating the assertion that
they were English, the natives requested them to sing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
a hymn, and, fortunately for the desperate men, one of
them remembered and sang a verse of a hymn he had
learnt somewhere, and so amazed the natives that they
let them go unharmed.</p>

<p>“Ingleza nta fombaka” (the Englishman never lies),
has passed into a proverb and is spreading not only
throughout the Congo, but even into Portuguese Angola.
Possessing the unbounded confidence of the native mind,
the Christian missionary, reinforced by practical medical
work, may, if he desires, possess the vast unoccupied
fields of the continent and obtain there an ever firmer
foothold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROTESTANT EXPENDITURE</div>

<p>Within recent years, however, Protestant missions
have taken up with increasing zeal industrial and commercial
enterprises in the interests of the natives. We
were unfortunate in being unable to visit what I am
told is one of the finest industrial enterprises in West
Africa—the Scotch Calabar Mission, but apart from
those of the Roman Catholics we inspected several
Protestant establishments. The British Government,
recognizing what is now becoming common ground, that
a purely literary and spiritual education does not produce
the most robust type of civilized African, is now
combining technical training in industries with literary
studies, and no longer gives grants of lump sums to
missions, but so much per head for the “finished product,”
<i>e.g.</i> a native attaining a given literary and technical
standard. In the Gold Coast the maximum per annum
is 27<i>s</i>. 6<i>d.</i> <i>per capita</i>. In a school at Christiansborg, the
annual upkeep of which costs £500, over £170 was earned
in one year by the ability of the scholars in this way.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
The Primitive Methodists have a very effective little
Industrial Mission on the Spanish island of Fernando Po.
Under the vigorous and enlightened leadership of the
Rev. Jabez Bell the mission situated at Bottler Point
is now so prosperous that the returns from the cocoa
farms together with subscriptions from the native
members, more than cover the expenditure. If in any
forthcoming rearrangement of the Map of Africa Fernando
Po should come under Germany the character
of the Primitive Methodist Mission on that island is
bound to appeal to the practical-minded Teuton.</p>

<p>The price which Christian missions have paid for
religious work amongst the pagan tribes of West Central
Africa can never be correctly estimated. In the Congo
alone Protestant missions have spent nearly one and a
quarter millions sterling within the last twenty-five
years. Out of some 550 missionaries, over 170 have gone
to an early grave, many not living six months, some
only a few days. These men and women were not only
the matured youth of their countries, but they were compelled
to pass the most rigid medical examination prior
to acceptance by the missionary boards. They were
indeed the flower of the Christian Church; moreover,
the very difficulties and dangers which were known to
exist, served to attract none but the strongest characters.
Some people, incapable of recognizing sterling qualities
in any but themselves, have written and spoken of
missionaries as those who could not have made their way
in any other sphere of life. Whatever may be true of
other mission fields, so far as the missionaries of West
Africa are concerned, the majority resigned good and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
assured positions and accepted a comparative pittance
in order that they might serve what surely is the greatest
of all causes. I have failed to obtain statistics from the
Roman Catholic Church, but the foregoing applies
equally to the devoted men of that body. With them,
as with the Protestants, it has been <i>via crucis via lucis</i>.</p>

<p>The following statistics, so far as they are a guide to
Christian progress, show some of the results achieved
by the missionary forces of Protestantism in West
Africa:—</p>

<p>From the statistical tables of the Protestant Missions,
we have a known membership and communicant list of
over 200,000 men and women, and nearly 80,000
scholars under daily Christian instruction. If to this be
added an equal number in connection with the Roman
Catholic Church—probably a generous estimate—West
Central Africa possesses a Christian Church of something
approaching half a million strong. This, however, does
not take into account the large native interest in Christianity
evidenced by the considerable purchase of the
Scriptures. Every year the British and Foreign Bible
Society ships some thousands of pounds worth of Bibles
to the different colonies, the natives contributing an
increasing sum to the Bible Society, which gives a
“return” in cash from the native Christian community
of the Protestant Churches of over £30,000 per annum,
or an average contribution of over 4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per head
throughout the Churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INDUSTRIAL RESULTS</div>

<p>The fact that the results of missionary industrial
enterprise are hampered by a not unreasonable dislike
to “profit-making” prevents embarkation upon those
bye-products of industrial activity which render commercial
enterprise financially sound. A missionary is
usually quite willing to teach men to adze timber, plane
boards, square joints, lay bricks, and grow cotton and
rubber, but he knows that his Board and its supporters
regard “profit” with a very critical eye. Richard
Blaize, an educated native of Abeokuta, left his
fortune to meet this difficulty and now extensive
workshops are erected at Abeokuta, and all the
public buildings of that splendid city have been erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
“at a profit” by the Christian Industrial School of
Abeokuta.</p>

<p>In the Gold Coast the German Basel Mission leads
the way with engaging vigour in the matter of industrial
missions. The commercial section of the Mission includes
industrial training institutes, and nothing could be more
pleasing than the interest and energy with which the
natives devote themselves to cabinet work, coach-building,
and agricultural pursuits; but the main
activities of this department are those of the ordinary
African merchant with the exception that the agents
are forbidden to sell spirituous liquors. This branch of
the work, which is conducted by twenty-three “mercantile”
missionaries, is in every respect admirable.
One of the leading railway managers remarked to me
that, “The most business-like commercial house in the
colony is the Basel Mission; their men always know
how many trucks they will require, their trolleys are
to time, their goods properly bagged and labelled, and
their whole organization so smart and up-to-date that
they never dislocate the traffic.” There can be little
doubt that the attention given to business by the representatives
of the Mission is due to the type of white men
they can command—none are accepted unless they agree
to make their employment a matter of conscience, and
develop their commercial undertakings with the same
motive as that which animates their spiritual brethren,
with whom they share all things in common, with the
exception of salaries, those of the mercantile brethren
being considerably higher and based, to some extent,
upon returns. The white agents are assisted by coloured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
men in charge of branches, many of whom can show a
record of service extending from 12 to 15 years, and some
of them are now drawing salaries—including commission—of
£500 per annum. These men are to be found on
Sundays teaching in the Sunday schools, and preaching
at the out-stations of the Mission.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus59" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus59.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">INTERIOR OF MISSIONARIES’ HOUSE. BASEL INDUSTRIAL
  MISSION. FURNITURE MADE BY GOLD COAST MISSION SCHOLARS.</p>
</div>

<p>The capital for these operations is derived, in the
main, from three sources: (1) the Basel Mission itself;
(2) shareholders connected with the Mission, whose
dividends are limited to 5 per cent. per annum; (3) from
funds in the Mission’s Savings Bank, into which the
natives of the colony have placed for security considerably
over £20,000 at interest varying from 3½ to 5 per
cent.</p>

<p>The results of the Mission’s work can be seen all over
the colony; the polite native clerks, the managers of
stores, the English-speaking planters, the coloured
Government officials have nearly all of them received
their training at the Basel Mission schools, and the
Acting Governor does not hesitate to recognize that his
best officials have been produced by the Mission. Testimony
of this nature is unhappily seldom forthcoming
from other colonies.</p>

<p>The industrial section usually executes orders to the
value of about £4000 per annum; its go-carts, trolleys,
traps, and waggonettes are sent into almost every colony
from Sierra Leone to German Cameroons. The net
profits of this department average slightly over £400 per
annum.</p>

<p>The commercial department is certainly one of the
most profitable enterprises in the colony, and the stores<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
of the Mission are crowded with purchasers throughout the
day. The exigencies of business naturally precluded the
possibility of obtaining with any degree of exactness
the volume of trade done by the Mission, but some of
the figures are eloquent testimony to the confidence the
natives have in these mercantile missionaries. In the
year 1909-1910, the Mission exported 35 tons of rubber,
14,000,000 lbs. of palm kernels, 600,000 gallons of
palm oil, and nearly 17,000,000 lbs. weight of cocoa
beans.</p>

<p>The profit-bearing transactions of the Basel Mission
cannot be much under £150,000, which on the moderate
basis of 8 per cent. net profit would provide the Mission
Exchequer with a sum of £12,000 per annum. Government
grants-in-aid of educational work amounted
in 1910 to £240. There are also periodic collections
in aid of Mission funds; the native Church at Nsaba,
for example, collected £240 last year. The whole
expenditure of this Mission must be almost, if not
completely, covered by its income from the various
operations.</p>

<p>Whatever the actual financial position of this
Mission, its general business operations, splendid educational
institutions, its devoutly spiritual atmosphere,
combine in forming one of the greatest—if not the greatest—force
for progress in the Gold Coast colony. But the
price has to be paid, for, according to the report of the
Acting Governor, “The highest death-rate was again
amongst the missionaries!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DANGER AHEAD</div>

<p>The future of Christianity in West Africa is hopeful
but it has its dangers. First its very success may lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
to disastrous consequences. In the early years the
mission work was almost entirely in the hands of the
extreme evangelical section of the Church, who subordinated
everything to the actual work of preaching.
We understand and sympathize with the fiery zeal that
believes in doing all the preaching, but the native
thinks the preacher a strange being, and frequently
does not understand two sentences of Anglicized Bantu,
or worse still, his Bantuized English! Circumstances
have broadened the outlook and men are beginning
to realize the value of training the native to do the
preaching, contenting themselves with an apparently
more restrictive sphere in the class-room and study.
The native preacher thus prepared is zealous to a degree,
and that he is ready to suffer incredible hardships and
even torture, we know from the romantic history of the
Uganda Mission. He is willing and able to carry his
message further afield than the white man could ever
hope to do; he is, moreover, able to present his message
through the medium of a complete mastery of the native
tongue. The results of this form of propaganda are
becoming almost startling. Christian evangelists from
one territory are meeting those of far distant regions
and in this manner the whole of the riverine systems
of Central Africa are coming rapidly under the influence
of Christianity. It is in this respect, rather than
in tabulated statistics, that one sees the onward
march of the Christian Faith. The bush native
no longer clings to and prides himself in paganism;
if he is not a Mohammedan, he will tell you he is a
Christian, even though his life and conduct would shut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
him out of the formal communion of any Christian
Church.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs may lead to a grave situation,
for already in several colonies the natives are restive
under an inadequate white control or leadership. Educated
in the principles of liberty, but without much
respect for, or belief in, the nobler tenets of the Christian
Faith, they are breaking away from Christian government
and forming themselves into Christian communities in
which personal desire is never allowed to conflict with
accepted standards of ethics. One day I visited a
leading “Christian” in a certain colony; he showed me
round the district, took me over his delightful little farm,
pointed out his model dwellings, machinery houses, and
so forth; then I inspected a building with three compartments
and was informed that one section was used
as a “gin store,” the middle section for prayer meetings,
and in the third the man kept his wives! All this
he boldly asserted could be justified by reference to the
Scriptures. I was not prepared to contest the assertion,
because my host claimed his own conscience as the final
arbiter of interpretation. The extent to which these
secessions may go can be gathered from the fact that one
such seceding church in West Africa claims a membership
of over 10,000 adults.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LIGHT ETERNAL</div>

<p>The missionary societies, unable to supply sufficient
men to cope with these vast areas, are forced to leave the
movement almost alone and thus it spreads, and will
continue to spread, until Central Africa is completely
brought under the influence of a form of Christianity
which for many years will be a caricature of the religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
of Christ. The only hope, and happily a probable development,
is that the religious wave, which is now moving
irresistibly across the central regions, will be followed
by an ethical wave which will give the “Light eternal”
to the Dark Continent.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MAP OF AFRICA RE-ARRANGED</span></h3>

</div>

<p>For some months past eminent publicists in Europe
have been busily engaged in rearranging the map of Africa
in the interests first of one Power, then of another, but
the unfortunate native has found scant place in these
arguments. The only question which seems of any
significance is the “price” this or that Power will pay
for a given slice of the African continent. It would be
rather interesting surely to know what the natives themselves
think of the proposed change. Some of them have
strong views upon the morality of disposing of other
people’s rights, to say nothing of treaty obligations which
they obtained when agreeing to European sovereignty.</p>

<p>Four territories are, so to speak, in the melting pot
of political speculation—British Gambia, French Congo,
Belgian Congo, and the Portuguese colonies of East and
West Africa. None of the Powers in control of these
territories desire to add another foot of tropical Africa
to the burden they carry already. Great Britain has a
full share of responsibilities in the African continent.
France, Belgium and Portugal, even if they desired to
enlarge their tropical dependencies, have not yet established
a case for expansion. Quite the reverse. One
Power alone—Germany—is not only capable but apparently
desirous of adding to her colonial possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITISH GAMBIA</div>

<p>Though Great Britain may have no wish to add to
her responsibilities, her people cannot allow her to relegate
any portion of them to another Power. British Gambia
must never be allowed to pass into the hands of France,
and the quicker the French Government is told this,
the better, not only for Anglo-French amity, but for the
tranquillity and progress of our oldest African colony.
Thanks to our merchant adventurers and the goodwill of
the natives, Gambia was able to hold her own against the
Portuguese, French and Dutch, until the British Government
assumed direct control.</p>

<p>The British Government made a solemn agreement
with the native tribes for a Protectorate over the Gambia
colony, and “this agreement shall stand for ever.” The
British Minister who sets that agreement aside will be
guilty of a crime against the fair fame of his country,
but more especially against the loyal natives who so
implicitly trust the unalterable promise of an Englishman.</p>

<p>The foregoing ethical argument cannot fail to find an
echo in the breast of every Britisher, but there are
Imperial reasons which reinforce that argument. The
Gambia river possesses a draught of 30 feet right up the
river to a position of twenty miles beyond Bathurst,
providing altogether forty miles of deep waterway. I
am told this is the only safe anchorage for a British fleet
in West Africa, safe, that is, from attack. This little
colony of 4000 square miles is contentedly following on
in the path of progress, its inhabitants are loyally and
affectionately attached to the British Crown. Only
one thing troubles the population of Gambia and that is
the periodic rumours of a transfer to another Power.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
A categorical and clear statement from a Minister of the
Crown that no such transference is contemplated or would
be entertained is the least the native has a right to expect,
and the Empire to demand.</p>

<p>Next in order of discussion has been the question of
Portuguese colonies, and it has been mooted more than
once that these should, either as a whole or in part, be
transferred by Portugal to Germany for a financial
consideration. The territories in question comprise Portuguese
East and West Africa together with the islands
of the Gulf of Guinea; the area of the mainland possessions
being 778,000 square miles and that of the islands
460 square miles, making a total area of 778,460 square
miles.</p>

<p>No experienced Power would be prepared to purchase,
even if Portugal would be prepared to sell, a portion only
of the Portuguese possessions, because the several
colonies properly managed dovetail into each others’
requirements in such a manner that a separation of either
would in all probability spell ruin to all. The richest
of the colonies is that small island of San Thomé, but it
cannot maintain its financial prosperity unless fed by
labour from the mainland colonies of East and West
Africa. Then the Angola finances are nearly balanced
by the financial position of the cocoa islands.</p>

<p>Another argument is put forth, to the effect that the
Portuguese treatment of natives demands a transfer of
the territory to some more progressive Power, such as, for
instance, Germany. Are those who advocate this policy
quite sure that the “Progressive Power” would treat
the natives better than the Portuguese? if so, where is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the evidence? Does East Africa provide it? Does the
treatment of the Herreros and the shooting of British
Kaffirs demonstrate it? Those who support a transfer
on this ground should not lightly pass over these and
similar incidents. They can be absolutely certain of
this one thing, that Germany would be “progressive”
enough to see to it that the cocoa plantations of San
Thomé had an abundant supply of labour—no matter
what the consequences to such a subordinate issue as
labour conditions.</p>

<p>Then I am told that “in any case the condition of
the natives as a whole could not be so bad under Germany
as under the Portuguese.” To this I cannot agree, for
though I admit that a number of colonial Portuguese are
slave traders, and that slavery is prevalent on the mainland
and on the islands, I must, in fairness to the Portuguese,
point out first that the Portuguese have a kindly
nature to which one can appeal, and secondly that signs
are not wanting of an awakening of the conscience of the
Portuguese nation in a manner which may lead to a
thorough cleansing of the colonial possessions of the
Republic. Thirdly, there is no colour-bar in the Portuguese
dominions.</p>

<p>To this argument I get the reply, “Public opinion in
Germany would insist on the abolition of existing slavery,”
but this is an argument which has no shred of foundation
in fact; Germany is, in many respects, a progressive
Power, but she has no philanthropic soul for the well-being
of native races. A single word from Germany
indicating a willingness to co-operate with Great Britain
during the Congo agitation would have saved thousands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
if not millions, of lives. That word was never spoken,
the Congo tribes were left to perish, and German public
opinion maintained a cynical attitude until the end. A
merchant or two rendered yeoman service, but they were
as voices crying in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Let Portugal retain her colonies, and resolutely begin
to purify their administration and abolish slavery, but
she must do it quickly if she is to retain the goodwill of
those—and they are still many—who would deplore her
disappearance from the map of Africa. She has said with
an intensity demanding appreciation that she will not
dispose of her ancient colonies, and this courageous reply
evoked a warm response from all her colonists who to a
man are intensely patriotic, but if Portugal should refuse
to abolish slavery, she cannot expect that her most powerful
Ally will be allowed to maintain an Alliance valued
to-day by many of us, yet viewed with increasing uneasiness
by a large section of the British Public. No one
wishes to utter a word which can be construed as a threat,
but every one knows that there are paths along which
no British Foreign Minister can lead, much less force the
nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BELGIAN CONGO</div>

<p>Belgian Congo figures largely in every proposal for a
rearrangement of the map of Africa. It is claimed that
Belgium has annexed more territory than she can safely
administer; certain it is that in annexing the Congo she
did not take over an ordinary colony. When Great
Britain assumed responsibility for her African colonies
their virgin wealth was practically untapped; the people
inhabiting the colonies, as a whole, welcomed the advent
of her rule, and moreover Great Britain had in all her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
territories, with the exception of Egypt, a free hand.
To a greater or less extent this applies to all African
Powers, other than Belgium. When Belgian annexation
took place, the Congo was in every respect a “squeezed
orange”; not only so, but the administration of that
territory must remain subject to the paternal control
of the European Powers. There is another feature which
should not be overlooked, and which may yet cause
difficulty. In the event of a general insurrection in French
or British colonies, or in the event of invasion, these
Powers can at once bring in an outside coloured army,
which can, if necessary, be reinforced with white troops.
Belgium can do neither. Let any material section of
the native army revolt, which, by the way, is the ever
present fear of its officers, and the Europeans must run
for their lives. They would call in vain for troops from
the Mother Country, for by the Belgian Constitution the
army may not be ordered abroad, and for other reasons
European forces could hardly be used in the Congo. With
the unification of language amongst the native troops
which is rapidly taking place, with the ever increasing
spread of knowledge as to the use of arms, this peril has
been gravely accentuated within recent years.</p>

<p>Apart from these general—and some of them, remote—difficulties,
there are existing reasons for believing that
the extensive Congo territories are too heavy a responsibility
for Belgium. The country is over eighty times
the size of Belgium, a proportion to the Mother Country
not by any means without parallel, but circumstances
differ so widely that they remove the question from all
comparison with any other incident of colonial expansion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
The only countries which at all compare with the Congo
are Uganda and Southern Nigeria, but these have not
suffered as the Congo has done from thirty years of the
maddest form of exploitation since Pizarro plundered
Peru.</p>

<p>Uganda is just about 100,000 square miles and the
Imperial grant-in-aid during the last ten years in direct
administrative assistance (excluding railway credits) is
no less than £1,075,000, or an average annual grant-in-aid
of £107,500. This, it will be observed, is approximately
an annual grant-in-aid of a sovereign per square mile.</p>

<p>The Belgian Congo cannot be managed upon less than
Uganda, therefore it should require grants-in-aid from the
Imperial Exchequer for the next twenty years, of not
less than £1,000,000 sterling per annum. To this,
however, must be added the exceptional demands from
which no colony escapes. The question, therefore, is
this: Are the Belgians ready to invest a sum of twenty
to thirty millions sterling in the Congo during the next
twenty to twenty-five years?</p>

<p>The Congo is thirteen times the size of Southern
Nigeria; and though the density of the Congo population
is considerably less, the tribes are much more
widely scattered, and therefore require almost the same
measure of white supervision, particularly in view of the
direct taxation which everywhere prevails. There is
the further consideration that many of the Belgian
“officials” are to-day necessarily occupied with work
which in other colonies is rightly left to the merchant.
In view of these considerations a <i>pro rata</i> white personnel
would seem to be essential. In Southern Nigeria Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
Britain has from 800 to 1000 white men of all grades
engaged in its administration. Taking the lowest figure
as a basis, the Belgium Congo, with its 900,000 square miles
of territory, coupled with the varied enterprises of the
administration, would require over 10,400 men, but the
colonial authorities find the greatest difficulty in maintaining
an official personnel of about 2000!</p>

<p>With a few notable exceptions, the type of official
on the Congo gives but little promise of any really effective
and enlightened administration. Can the Belgian
Government find the men which the colony requires?
None can say actually what she may be able to do,
although none will deny that up to the present she has
failed to find either the number or the class of men vital
to successful colonial government.</p>

<p>The question the Belgians would do well to ask
themselves is—whether it would not be wiser for them to
administer a smaller colony properly than to continue an
attempt to govern a vast region like the Congo basin,
which, in the very nature of things, would be an enormous
task even for the most affluent European Power.</p>

<p>If Belgium could retain the Lower Congo, or a considerable
portion of it, and transfer almost the whole of
the upper regions to another Power, the indemnity she
might expect to receive would, in such a case, permit of
the development of the Lower Congo in a manner which
would absorb all the activity that she could throw into
it for generations. There are great possibilities in the
Lower Congo, possibilities unprejudiced by the difficulties
which obtain in the Upper Congo.</p>

<p>If the Belgians would agree to the disposal of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
major part of the Upper Congo, the problem which would
then confront statesmen would be that of finding another
Power willing to assume so large a responsibility. France
has the reversionary right, but could not be expected to
add to her already too great African responsibilities.
Clearly Great Britain could not accept the burden in view
of the lead she took in the work of securing reforms.
Portugal cannot effectively administer the territories she
already possesses. We are thus driven to look to Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMANY AND BELGIAN CONGO</div>

<p>It seems to be everywhere accepted that Germany
would be willing to spend men and money on the administration
of a large tropical colony, but again, is she prepared
to accept the task of governing the Upper Congo?</p>

<p>A readiness to do so could hardly be other than
welcome to the European Powers, always providing that
Belgium were willing to share her present burden with
Germany.</p>

<p>Such a transfer would not only unite the German
colony of Cameroons with the Congo colony, but also
with German East Africa, thus giving to Germany a great
and uninterrupted trans-African colony larger than that
possessed by any European Power in Africa. But the
fatal objection to this re-arrangement is that there is no
short and easy route to the sea which would be essential
to a German control of the Congo. Even if the Matadi-Leopoldville
railway territory were transferred, which
would be extremely unlikely, the German Government
would know that it was only a temporary route to the
ocean.</p>

<p>Is it impossible for the Powers of Europe to take a
truly large view of the situation and by making an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
immediate sacrifice, which in point of fact would be
advantageous to each Power concerned, and thereby
place the peace of the world upon a lasting basis? Is it
entirely out of the question to persuade France for an
adequate <i>quid pro quo</i> to transfer the major part of
French Congo also to Germany?</p>

<p>France knows how she has been drawn into an almost
impossible situation in that wretched colony, she knows
how difficult it is for her to cleanse and administer it
upon lines which are in accord with the obligations
imposed upon her by the Berlin Conference. If France
and Belgium together could be persuaded to transfer the
whole, or the greater part, of French and Belgian Congo
to Germany, a comparatively quick route to the ocean
would be possible for the upper reaches of the Congo basin.
If these two Powers could be brought to agree to such
a transfer to Germany, they would individually be immeasurably
the gainers, they would secure the peace of
the world, and they would thereby add a lustre to their
names which neither time nor eternity could tarnish.</p>

<p>Experience has shewn us that commerce need have
no fear, for Germany welcomes and treats fairly the
commercial houses of all nations. No favour is granted
to a German firm which is prejudicial to the representatives
of other Powers, whereas to-day the notorious fact is
that merchants refuse to extend their commercial enterprises
in French and Belgian Congo owing to the restrictions
and irritating dues and charges which are imposed.</p>

<p>The remaining difficulty and the chief one is that of
the treatment of the natives. Doubtless if it were possible
to consult them, they would in both colonies vote for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
transfer, not because they know anything of German rule,
but because they would hope that a change would not
involve them in a worse condition than they suffer at
present. German administration of French Congo
certainly could hardly be more oppressive than the French
Government permits to-day. In Belgian Congo the
natives would probably be treated as humanely and
probably more justly than at present. Finally it is
hoped that the German administration will, with the
march of time, become less rigorous in theory and more
humane in practice. On the whole, both from the
commercial and native standpoint, the Congo basin
stands to gain by a transfer to the German Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE IN THE WORLD</div>

<p>This transfer, joining as it would the Cameroons with
German East Africa, would provide Germany with a
single African colony of something over two million square
miles in extent; occupied by a population of from twenty-five
to thirty millions of people. A fertile colony larger
than our Indian Empire, and approximately the same
square mileage as the total possessions of Great Britain
in the African continent.</p>

<p>The paramount question is, of course, what <i>quid pro
quo</i> could Germany give in return for a re-arrangement of
the African continent which would provide her with so
vast a domain? Belgium would probably be willing to
accept a cash indemnity with the retention of such
portion of the Congo territory as she could safely and
effectively administer. France is the only difficulty; but
if France chose to be generous enough to part with French
Congo, might not such a spirit find an echo across the
Rhine? To put this into plain language, would not this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
vast colonial expansion thus placed in the hands of
Germany be worth a rectification of the frontier of Alsace-Lorraine—or
at least the gift of autonomy?</p>

<p>Such a solution of a great African problem would
give a ray of light and hope to the darkest regions of the
“Dark Continent,” whilst in Europe it would settle for
generations the peace of the world; surely a fitting
monument to erect to the memory of the martyred
millions of the Congo!</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
